# PapaScott

The [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) version of PapaScott. For build speed, only posts from 2015
and later are rendered here. Older posts and archives are transparently
proxied from the old Jekyll repository.

My code was inspired by
[https://unlikenesses.github.io/](https://unlikenesses.github.io/)
(repository at https://github.com/unlikenesses/unlikenesses.github.io).
