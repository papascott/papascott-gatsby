# PapaScott

The [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) version of PapaScott. For build speed, only posts from 2015
and later are rendered here. Older posts and archives are transparently
proxied from the [old Jekyll repository](https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io).

My code was inspired by
[https://unlikenesses.github.io/](https://unlikenesses.github.io/)
([repository](https://github.com/unlikenesses/unlikenesses.github.io)).
