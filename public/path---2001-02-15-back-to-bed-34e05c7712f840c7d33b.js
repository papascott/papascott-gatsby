My co-workers all asked me about my red eyes. I didn't even know they were red, but they apparently look like I was on 3 day drinking binge. (Of course, there was noone at home to tell me that my eyes were red, except for the little one and he's not talking yet.) And the dull pain (now on both sides) in my throat is numbed somewhat by paracetamol, but always comes back. This is no ordinary cold, so it's back to the doctor tomorrow morning. But I'm going to bed right now. 20:50 and stop counting.</p>",fields:{title:"Back to Bed",date:"15 Feb 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-02-15-back-to-bed/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-02-15-back-to-bed/",prev:{fields:{title:"Blog You",date:"14 Feb 2001",slug:"/2001-02-14-blog-you/"}},next:{fields:{title:"What A Difference A Day Makes",date:"16 Feb 2001",slug:"/2001-02-16-what-a-difference-a-day-makes/"}}}}}});
