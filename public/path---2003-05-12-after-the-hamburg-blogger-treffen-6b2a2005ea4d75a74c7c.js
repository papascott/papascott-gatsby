Nine of us us altogether, and except for Heiko, I didn\'t \'know\' anyone until last night. The group was quite diverse, including two people from the local blogging start-up <a href="http://www.20six.de/">20six</a> and a couple of diarists from <a href="http://www.diaryland.com/">Diaryland</a>, who find it amazing that some of us blog under our real names. Of course I didn\'t note names or URLs, although Heiko took pictures. I\'m already looking forward to next time, someplace quieter where it\'s easier to talk. (By the way, I never paid for my drinks. Do I owe anyone?)</p>',fields:{title:"After the Hamburg Blogger-Treffen",date:"12 May 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-05-12-after-the-hamburg-blogger-treffen/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-05-12-after-the-hamburg-blogger-treffen/",prev:{fields:{title:"A Boy and His Pelican",date:"12 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-12-a-boy-and-his-pelican/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Estonia blazes internet trail",date:"12 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-12-estonia-blazes-internet-trail/"}}}}}});
