In today\'s Euro-Parliament election (results presented between <a href="http://www.euro2004.com/">Euro 2004</a> matches), with less than 22% the SPD has its worst national post-war result. They have less than half the vote of the Union (45%). Maybe Schröder should think about buying the rights to Project 18 from the FDP.</p>\n<p>What I find worrying is that some of those SPD voters are heading to the ex-communist PDS. Over 6% in the Europe vote, in today\'s state election in Thuringa over 26% (SPD just 15%).  Fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former SED should by all rights be in the dustbin of history. The failed German reunification is keeping them alive.</p>',fields:{title:"Euro Election",date:"13 Jun 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-06-13-euro-election/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-06-13-euro-election/",prev:{fields:{title:"Begging for GMail",date:"11 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-11-begging-for-gmail/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Sherpas for WordPress",date:"13 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-13-sherpas-for-wordpress/"}}}}}});
