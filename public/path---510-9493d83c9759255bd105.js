It also serves as the serial console for most of our Suns, so the machine has to stay up and usable. Over the past couple of weeks performance had degraded steadily. Rebooting would solve the problem at first, but within an hour the load would again be maxxed out, even though the CPU was mostly idle and no RAM was being swapped. I installed a new kernel. I replaced the network card (which was spewing errors). I tried stopping services. I turned off the software RAID. Nothing helped.</p>\n<p>Finally today I stumbled upon the answer. The mail logs from our postfix servers were not being rotated. We had customized syslog to save the mail logs with non-standard names, and my predecessor had put the logrotate configuration for the custom log files not where I\'d expect, in /etc/logrotate.conf (which I had copied over from the old system), but in a file named \'guenther\' (name changed to protext the guilty) under /etc/logrotate.d/.

And Aznar bows out not so gracefully, handing power to the leftist oppostition rather than his designated successor. The message of the voters is not one of weakness in the face of terror, but rather an insistance that any government deal honestly with its citizens in time of crisis. Voters by definition are always right. Do not lie to them, they do not take deception lightly.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Wikipedia: March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks",date:"12 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-12-wikipedia-march-11-2004-madrid-attacks/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"You're a handsome blog, what's your owner's name?",date:"14 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-14-youre-a-handsome-blog-whats-your-owners-name/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:510,pageCount:1101}}}});
