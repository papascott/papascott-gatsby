Even with an established system you can still screw up royally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Weathering unexpected situations without a financial cushion can be problematic even for an established franchise. Ed Moran, an accountant in Tucson, Ariz., recalls a McDonalds Corp. franchisee whose dominance of a small California community was suddenly challenged by the arrival of a competing burger restaurant. The first year, the rival knocked 30% off the McDonalds stores sales. Unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle, the McDonalds franchisee instead reduced his labor overhead and raised prices. He went into a spiral and never came out, Mr. Moran says.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle...</em> that sounds like an epitaph rather than a sound business strategy.
