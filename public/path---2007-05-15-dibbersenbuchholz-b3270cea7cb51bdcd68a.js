For us the restaurant is just 10 minutes drive from home.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/499677510/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/208/499677510_c2fb7ddf5c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Dibbersen" /></a></p>\n<p>The restaurant with McDrive was opened in 2003 and does not yet have a McCafé. It is located near a thriving commercial area with the furniture store Möbel Kraft and a new Obi home improvement store. A Famila supermarket and a MediaMarkt electronics store are planned for this year. We have every reason to expect satisfaction and success for years to come.</p>\n<p>**Update:** MamaMaus has a soft spot for signage. This will be ours.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/dibberson-sign.jpg" alt="sign" height="352" width="264" /></p>',fields:{title:"Dibbersen/Buchholz",date:"15 May 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-05-15-dibbersenbuchholz/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-05-15-dibbersenbuchholz/",prev:{fields:{title:"Concrete",date:"12 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-12-concrete/"}},next:{fields:{title:"im in ur serverz",date:"16 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-16-im-in-ur-serverz/"}}}}}});
