Right facts, wrong conclusion. The reason service is so bad in restaurants (and shops) in Germany is not the \'demise of the German work ethic\'. As far as I know, German service has <i>never</i> been good. Restaurants and shops are chronically short staffed, and customers are seen by employees as an annoyance.
