Actually, most of the permalink was easy, thanks to <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/15/slugs" title="Cruft-free URLs in Movable Type [dive into mark]">Mark Pilgrim\'s cruft-free URLs</a>. The problem was the slash at the end. </p>\n<p>I\'ve forgotten where, but somewhere I read that cool links end with a slash, since the URI is then a directory and it doesn\'t matter what filetype (if there is indeed a file at all) contains the page, the URI won\'t change. However, MT doesn\'t differentiate between the permalink and the filename that it saves. If you try to set MTEntryPermalink to a directory, MT tries to write to the directory instead of a file, which of course fails.</p>\n<p>One approach is to set MTEntryPermalink to blah-blah/index.html, and write a one-line <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html#plugins" title="add_global_filter(slashify=>sub{my $s=$_[0];$s=~s!index.[\\w]*$!!g;$s;});">global filter plugin</a> to delete the filename from every instance of MTEntryPermalink in all templates. I tried it, but it\'s a pain to add an attribute to all those instances, and the trackback data was still wrong.</p>\n<p>A better approach is <a href="http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2003/09/24/permalink_urls/" title="Dave Dribin\'s blog: Fixing Movable Type\'s Permalink URLs">Dave Dribin\'s patch to MT.pm</a> so you can set MTEntryPermalink to a directory, and have MT save the template to a file index.html (or index.whatever). That\'s what I\'m doing now, but of course the problem with a patch is that it\'s a patch, and you have to remember to re-apply it when MT 4.0 or 3.2 or 3.112384 is released. But maybe the same thing can be accomplished with the new plugin architecture in MT3. Stay tuned.</p>',fields:{title:"Slash My Permalinks",date:"08 Oct 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-10-08-slash-my-permalinks/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-10-08-slash-my-permalinks/",prev:{fields:{title:"No Exorcism",date:"08 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-08-no-exorcism/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Game 3 ALDS",date:"09 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-09-game-3-alds/"}}}}}});
