Teenagers don\'t have sex any later, or are any more likely to use birth control... in other words, all sex education is useless, whether abstinence-based or not. (That makes sense to me, sex education was one of the most boring subjects in junior high, and turned out to be of no practical use.)</p>\n<p>Then I find out that <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives2/004209.php">drinking age also makes no difference</a>. The US (along with Indonesia, Mongolia and Palau) has the highest drinking age in the world, yet "high school students in much of the rest of the developed world  where lower drinking ages and laxer enforcement reign  do considerably better than US students on standardized tests".</p>\n<p>Next they\'ll tell me that <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0079813/">rock and roll does not cause brain damage in mice</a>.

He now has an official Legoland Driver\'s License for Germany, even though he ran at least one red light and wrongly signalled most of his turns (he\'d signal right, then turn left, or vice versa). Whatever. The back side of the license is a (fake) <a href="http://www.statoil.com/">StatOil</a> credit card, and they just happen to be the main sponsor of the Traffic School. Good thing we don\'t have any StatOil stations in Germany.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Founding the Business",date:"14 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-14-founding-the-business/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Rails is an ogre, and ogres have layers",date:"16 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-16-rails-is-an-ogre-and-ogres-have-layers/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:140,pageCount:1101}}}});
