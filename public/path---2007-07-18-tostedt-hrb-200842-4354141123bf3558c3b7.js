(GmbH is short for <em>Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung</em>, literally "company with limited liability", a form of incorporation common in Germany.)</p>\n<p>Theoretically the formation of a GmbH takes only a week, but the papers returned twice (or was it three times) by the court to our notary for minor errors. We had become extremely annoyed by the entire process, and finally yesterday Frauke personally went to the court yesterday to finalize the process. We absolutely needed the HRB number now in order to register and get plates for her company car, which is being delivered today.</p>\n<p>The lack of papers has also complicated our dealings with the bank and the Finanzamt (not only for our own taxes, but for VAT and withholding taxes from wages), and not least delayed the formal purchase contract for the restaurant.
