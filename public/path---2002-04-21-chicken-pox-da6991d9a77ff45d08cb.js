It was going around at day care two weeks ago, and we noticed the first blisters and a fever while on the plane. He's not that uncomfortable yet, but he must be highly contagious. So it probably won't be a good idea for us to visit Ian today. I've got the first nap duty, so I'm with him in the room trying out the cable modem at the hotel :-). </p>\n<p><b>Update</b> <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/skin/chicken_pox.html\">Here's</a> everything you never wanted to know about chicken pox. Christopher is at starting to itch, but is still in relatively good spirits. He was up from midnight until exactly 5:18 am (with Mama's wake-up call at 6:30). Do I get extra Papa Points for staying up with him? Let's just say it would have been a hell of a lot more convenient to be going through this at home!</p>",fields:{title:"Chicken Pox",date:"21 Apr 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-04-21-chicken-pox/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-04-21-chicken-pox/",prev:{fields:{title:"On Our Way!",date:"19 Apr 2002",slug:"/2002-04-19-on-our-way/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Pox Be Gone",date:"23 Apr 2002",slug:"/2002-04-23-pox-be-gone/"}}}}}});
