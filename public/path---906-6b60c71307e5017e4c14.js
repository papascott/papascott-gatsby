I found that it's not quite the cats meow, not yet, and I recommended that we wait for an update with bugfixes and then try it again. Display of fonts (rather important for Office documents) just isn't quite good enough yet for daily use on a relatively current machine (Mandrake 8,1), and I couldn't get fonts to display right at all on an older installation (Mandrake 7.x) . It's promising, and I'll keep an eye on it, even if it's not quite usable yet.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"SpamBouncer",date:"08 Apr 2002",slug:"/2002-04-08-spambouncer/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"End of an Era",date:"09 Apr 2002",slug:"/2002-04-09-end-of-an-era/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"SpamBouncer",date:"08 Apr 2002",slug:"/2002-04-08-spambouncer/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>I\'ve installed <a href="http://www.spambouncer.org/">SpamBouncer</a>, a procmail-based spam filter, at my hoster account.

They were here this time last year too. They seem to like canned cat food. So they are all over the cat dish in the entryway. Mama noticed this early this morning, took the ant-infested cat dish outside, and put a new dish in the kitchen. The ants took this as an invitation to come to the kitche, so by the time Christopher and I woke up, the ants were in there. And in the living room. But I found where they are coming from. They can run back in their hole, but they can\'t hide forever. I have a can of bug spray, and I\'m not afraid to use it!</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we have discovered that we are out of toilet paper. In a household where all lives revolve around a two-year-old, practical necessities sometimes get forgotten. After all, Christopher doesn\'t need it yet. He does use toilet paper, as <a href="/2001/11/25">we mentioned a few months ago</a>, but as we noted at the time, he doesn\'t follow the manufacturer\'s operating instructions. Unfortunately, this not being the land of unlimited possibilities, we cannot take care of this need online.
