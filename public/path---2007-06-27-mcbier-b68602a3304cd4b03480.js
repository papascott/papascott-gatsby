Beer is a standard menu item in Germany, but it's a very low seller. We'd only sell 3 or 4 each day. The permit to sell beer costs Â€960 per year, so we didn't have to think very hard to decide that it was not worth it. Instead we will offer alcohol-free beer, which fits in better with the image we want to present anyway.</p>\n<p>There's an Aral gas station across the street, and anyone who really wants beer would go there in the first place. They have better selection and don't pour the beer into a paper cup.</p>",fields:{title:"McBier",date:"27 Jun 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-06-27-mcbier/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-06-27-mcbier/",prev:{fields:{title:"100 Hours",date:"26 Jun 2007",slug:"/2007-06-26-100-hours/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Before...",date:"29 Jun 2007",slug:"/2007-06-29-before/"}}}}}});
