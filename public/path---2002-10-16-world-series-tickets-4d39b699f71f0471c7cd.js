I remember 1987 in Minnesota, when the Twins somewhat unexpectedly stumbled into the World Series. We had followed them somewhat religiously that year, attending some 20 games (we would bike to the Metrodome and usually sit in the $3 bleacher seats). Once the team made the playoffs, we looked at our bank account and said, no, we couldn't afford any playoff tickets. Or World Series tickets. And we stuck to our decision. We watched Game 7 at a neighborhood sports bar full of Cardinal fans (our South Minneapolis neighborhood had a lot of black 'immigrants' from St. Louis). </p>\n<p>I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but that World Series marked a turning point for the two of us. For me, it was the beginning of the end of my graduate studies; 6 months later I had dropped out of graduate school. For Mama, her boss announced that fall that he was moving to Arizona, the beginning of a series of job changes which ended 3 years later in Germany.</p>",fields:{title:"World Series Tickets",date:"16 Oct 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-10-16-world-series-tickets/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-10-16-world-series-tickets/",prev:{fields:{title:"Ping Test 2",date:"16 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-16-ping-test-2/"}},next:{fields:{title:"My Chaotic Life",date:"17 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-17-my-chaotic-life/"}}}}}});
