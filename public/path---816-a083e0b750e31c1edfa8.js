That\'s nice. </p>\n<p>For German .de domains there is no evil Network Solutions/Verisign monopoly. There is a  central registrar <a href="http://www.denic.de/">DENIC</a>, but as an end-user you deal with your provider or hoster. I moved papascott.de to a <a href="http://www.cornerhost.com">hoster</a> in the US, and they are obviously not a DENIC member, so I had to find a domain-only provider. I\'ve used <a href="http://www.nrw.net/">one</a> in the past, without any problems, but I thought I\'d try <a href="http://www.united-domains.de/">someone new</a> that was a bit less expensive and with online domain administration and a free basic DNS (only one A record, but that\'s all I need). </p>\n<p>Apparently they recycled my paperwork, and after having set up my domain on Saturday, they set it up again on Wednesday, erasing my previous settings (and my A record). papascott.de then resolved to their <a href="http://62.146.28.82/">redirect server</a>. I was able to correct the A record immediately when I saw the error, but their DNS has a TTL of 24 hours, meaning that everyone who had received the bad address wouldn\'t get the correct address for 24 hours. In the meantime I set up a series of redirects that send the bad address to the temporary domain.</p>\n<p>All of this would have been catastrophic if I would actually post anything of value here. As it was, the damage was minimal. And I could have avoided all this by using a <a href="http://www.easydns.com/">real DNS hoster</a>, even though they cost extra.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Springsteen Kommt",date:"15 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-15-springsteen-kommt/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"The New Number Two",date:"16 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-16-the-new-number-two/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Springsteen Kommt",date:"15 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-15-springsteen-kommt/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Abendblatt: <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/11/15/92880.html">Springsteen kommt</a>! 2 June 2003, AOL Arena, Hamburg.
