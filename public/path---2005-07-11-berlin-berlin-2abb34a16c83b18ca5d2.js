We did a lot of touristy things, but not at real fast pace as we had a 5-year-old in tow. The highlight on Saturday was coffee with <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">J&ouml;rg</a>, <a href="http://www.gabi-kantel.de/">Gabi</a> and <a href="http://zebu.server-wg.de/">Zebu</a>, followed by a walk through  <a href="http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baulueckenmanagement/en/informationen/neukoelln/index.shtml">Neuk&ouml;lln</a>, where in the modern city there are still many signs of the old Bohemian village (as well as a couple of nice playgrounds for Christopher). On Sunday morning we queued up to visit the <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/info/050vberl.html">Dome atop the Reichstag building</a>. We had imagined a closed dome that was part of the session hall, but it fact it\'s a separate open-air structure, and we spent over an hour there enjoying the breeze and the view. We then took a cruise in the sunshine on the Spree river and headed home.</p>',fields:{title:"Berlin!
