The US can control the ball, but it looks like they\'ve made the mistake of bringing stiletto knives to an axe fight. They\'re trailing 2:0 at halftime. At least they\'ve mastered the offside trap, which the Germans still need to work on.</p>\n<p>Germans have this thing about complicated football (er, soccer) pools, so you can see how badly I\'ve predicted at <a href="http://www.kicktipp.de/blogtipp/tippuebersicht">Blogtipp</a>. I did pick the Czech Republic to win the Cup, based on two simulations I read about. One was a video game, the other a beer competition in Stern. Good enough for me.</p>\n<p>The best Internet live commentary, by the way, is at the <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006">Guardian</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> and not just because they <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/minbymin/0,,1788207,00.html">quote</a> my emails (scroll down to 83 minutes).</p>\n<p>Conclusion: 3:0. This has been a Cup without blowouts, until now. The US was energetic, but unimaginative. How did the US ever earn the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/statistics/index/0,2548,All-May-2006,00.html">5th place FIFA ranking</a>? In March against Germany, and again today, we\'ve been outclassed. </p>',fields:{title:"USA - Czech Republic",date:"12 Jun 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-06-12-usa-czech-republic/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-06-12-usa-czech-republic/",prev:{fields:{title:"From the World Cup Front",date:"08 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-08-from-the-world-cup-front/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Heroes and Villains",date:"16 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-16-heroes-and-villains/"}}}}}});
