A massive manhunt resulted in a warrant today against a test driver employed by Daimler Chrysler.</p>\n<p>We\'ve experienced this fear, even in Mama\'s BMW, which can easily keep pace with almost any other vehicle on the road. On a winter day a few years ago on an extremely icy autobahn, we were nearly forced off the road by a black Audi. A month later, we received a letter from the Autobahn police. They had been observing the Audi, and asked if we remembered the incident and whether we had felt threatened. We certainly did remember, and we had felt threatened. </p>\n<p>We heard nothing further.

The Iraqis would be deciding for themselves, without the help of western journalists or editorialists, it would be a process that would take many months, and the proof would be in the facts and events in Iraq, not in the words of pundits.</p>\n<p>Even in April it was clear that an troops would be in Iraq for at least two years, well past the 2004 election. And I also remember thinking back then that, from his timing of the war, President Bush was handing the fate of his re-election away from US voters and to the Iraqi people. If, say, in the summer of 2004 the occupation is going badly, the Iraqis do not feel liberated and \'better off than they were 4 years ago\', if US soldiers are still killing and being killed, Iraq would then dominate the US election and Bush would be like LBJ in 1968, namely toast.</p>\n<p>I also decided back in April that it would take at least 6 months to draw any conclusions as to whether the occupation is going well or poorly. But maybe the American public isn\'t going to <a title="BuzzMachine: Bye bye Bush?" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_08.html#004514">wait that long</a>, according to a <a title="VOANews.com" href="http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=AA40140D-FF3F-4B8D-AEB579CA3DBB57E7">Newsweek poll</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><p>49 percent of registered voters would not back the president for a second term if the vote were held now. Forty-four percent would support Mr. Bush\'s re-election....  Only 18 percent of those polled believe a stable, democratic government can be set up in Iraq in the long term. And only 13 percent of respondents said U.S. efforts to establish security in Iraq and rebuild the country have gone well</p></blockquote>\n<p>It looks like the future is now.
