I stayed home with Christopher yesterday. The thing is, he doesn't realize he's sick, so I had to keep reminding him that he has to keep his socks on, he can't go outside, and maybe he should take a nap (he didn't). Today he is sleeping in. He's well enough to go to the Tagesmutter, once he wakes up, but now it's already past 9, I wouldn't make it to the office until 10:30, and would have to leave right at 4.  My boss has offered to be flexible at such times, and today I think I'll take him up on it. At worst I'd take a vacation day from next year.

All politics are local, and I would have chosen my party based on domestic issues.</p>\n<p>I'm no great fan of George W. Bush, and my own opinion on Iraq is ambivalent. I can't think of a good reason to use force against Iraq, but then again, I can't think of a good reason not to, either. The attack on Iraq is inevitable, and I believe that it would be best for Germany to play little or no role in it.</p>\n<p>However, I am very distressed by the rhetoric Schröder chose to use, and the resulting deterioration in US-German relations. He could have expressed an anti-war platform without attacking the US leadership. But he chose to make it personal, and in so doing created an atmosphere that made stupid, outrageous, unthinkable comments like those by Däubler-Gmelin possible and thinkable (she was a third-rank minister quoted out of context, but that's not the point).</p>\n<p>Schröder was calculating that since Bush seems to have already made up his mind to attack Iraq, Germany would have no influence on the decision and he could go public with his opposition. On the surface, that is true. The American decision on Iraq wouldn't have been influenced one iota by German opposition or support. But at a deeper level, human emotions play a role in foreign policy that goes beyond the mere projection of national interest. This is even more true for nations like the United States that are founded on moral ideals, as opposed to 'merely' being based on a common people and culture (like, for example, Germany). This feeling of loyalty and trust is right now shattered, and it goes beyond the feelings of two leaders who haven't gotten along from the start.</p>\n<p>Schröder didn't want to become anti-American. He just wanted to win an election. He would do best just to stay quiet on foreign policy for a while, let the war on Iraq develop without comment, and let his foreign minister try to pick up the pieces. </p>\n<p>For a view from the States, Steve Den Beste has two articles <a href=\"http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/09/GermanAmericanRelations.shtml\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/09/HowwillAmericanpolicytowa.shtml\">here</a> reacting to the election and describing how bad things have gotten.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Schill Party: 0.6%",date:"23 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-23-schill-party-06/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Where Did The Time Go?",date:"24 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-24-where-did-the-time-go/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Schill Party: 0.6%",date:"23 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-23-schill-party-06/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Translated from <a href=\"http://www.welt.de\">Die Welt</a>: Hamburg - The Schill Party received ca. 4.4 percent of the vote in Hamburg (nationwide: ca. 0.6 percent).
