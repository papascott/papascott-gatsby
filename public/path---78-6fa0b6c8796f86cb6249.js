Direct flights to Orlando were full for the dates we wanted, so we ended up choosing US Airways in coach from Frankfurt with a stop at their hub in Charlotte.</p>\n<p>I've heard that US Airways has been having service problems since their merger with America West, so we weren't expecting any luxury. We weren't disappointed. The seats were tight on legroom, and there were charges for headsets and alcoholic beverages. Most annoying, however, was the check-in system, which separate our seats on 3 of the 6 legs, despite having reserved seats together. We weren't able to check-in online (because the Hamburg-Frankfurt leg was on a partner carrier), so we were at the mercy of the airport attendants. We were able to trade seats in the plane to sit together, but it's still a pain. Our colleagues in business class, however, were happy with their flight.</p>\n<p>In contrast, our experience changing planes in Charlotte was wonderful. Customs and immigration was quick and efficient, luggage transfer was easy, walking distances from gate to gate were short, and the airport was comfortable for waiting, even when our Orlando flight was delayed for 2 hours, with plenty of shops and bars to pass the time. The central throughway is outfitted with wooden rocking chairs, for a Southern front-porch feeling which we thought was cute.</p>\n<p>Coming back, we were slightly late coming into Frankfurt and had only 45 minutes connection times. We ran from Gate C to Gate A and just made it... our luggage, however, did not, and was delivered to our home by taxi that evening. But you need to plan at least an hour for any transfer at Frankfurt, or longer if changing terminals and not just gate areas.</p>\n<p>All in all, if flying to the States with a change of planes, we advise planning the change in a smaller airport like Charlotte, and avoiding huge hubs like LaGuardia or O'Hare. Too bad the only airline flying to Charlotte is US Airways.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Convention Postcard",date:"19 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-19-convention-postcard/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Sprayed Again",date:"23 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-23-sprayed-again/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Convention Postcard",date:"19 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-19-convention-postcard/",tags:"Y2008"},html:'<p><a href="http://74.200.84.250/?rc=b9da3dc82a68b8f5e2f3869f24ebdb80&re=bac5e46ebcf9ecedd25695087d117d7a"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/postcard.jpg" alt="postcard.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>\n<p><br clear="both" />We spent the past week at the McDonald\'s Worldwide Convention in Orlando, and we able to send a <a href="http://74.200.84.250/?rc=b9da3dc82a68b8f5e2f3869f24ebdb80&re=bac5e46ebcf9ecedd25695087d117d7a">video postcard</a> to prove we were there.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Open All Night",date:"08 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-08-open-all-night/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"US Airways through Charlotte",date:"20 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-20-us-airways-through-charlotte/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Open All Night",date:"08 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-08-open-all-night/",tags:"Y2008"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/sp-50-8-27956-36028-1.jpg" alt="SP-50-8-27956_36028-1.jpg" border="0" width="494" height="110" /></p>\n<p>Staying open 24 hours is an idea we briefly considered but then rejected... the night traffic at our restaurant is just too light. So we close the drive-thru at 1 during the week and at 4 on weekends. But now our restaurant manager has convinced us that on weekends the potential is there, and presented us with a staffing concept to stay open all night Friday and Saturday with no additional labor costs. So we\'re going for it! Starting the first weekend in May, our drive-thru will stay open all night on Friday and Saturday. Even if we only break even, the advertising potential will be worth the effort</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Black and White",date:"08 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-08-black-and-white/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Convention Postcard",date:"19 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-19-convention-postcard/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:78,pageCount:1101}}}});
