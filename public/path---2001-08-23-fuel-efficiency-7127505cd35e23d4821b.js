The top prizes went to the VW 3-Liter Lupo and the Audi A2 1.2 TDI 3L, which both achieve 2.9 liters per 100 km, which <a href="http://www.digest.net/bmw/archive/v5/msg00097.html">converts</a> to 81 miles per gallon. The average new car uses 7.3&nbsp;l/100&nbsp;km (32 mpg), but over 10 l (less than 24 mpg) in the city. If Germans drove pickups and SUVs as frequently as Americans, the numbers would be worse. (However, unlike in the US, pickups and SUVs here have to meet the same safety standards as passenger cars, so most US models aren\'t available.)</p>',fields:{title:"Fuel Efficiency",date:"23 Aug 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-08-23-fuel-efficiency/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-08-23-fuel-efficiency/",prev:{fields:{title:"I'm Now Famous",date:"22 Aug 2001",slug:"/2001-08-22-im-now-famous/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Hot and Sticky",date:"24 Aug 2001",slug:"/2001-08-24-hot-and-sticky/"}}}}}});
