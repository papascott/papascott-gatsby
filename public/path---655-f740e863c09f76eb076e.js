In Germany, the language we speak in the US is often referred to as "Amerikanisch", as if it has nothing to do with English. Even better is to be referred to as a "US-Amerikaner", which even though it incorporates the beloved letters \'USA\', to me sounds like PC mumbo-jumbo. I mean, even though there is North America and South America, there does not exist an \'America\' of which the US is a subset. Please, just call me \'Ami\'!</p>\n<p>(Orginally submitted as a comment to Buzz Machine, but I decided it was worth a post.)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Humanitarian success in postwar Iraq is essential",date:"13 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-13-humanitarian-success-in-postwar-iraq-is-essential/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"2nd Hamburg Blogger Meeting",date:"14 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-14-2nd-hamburg-blogger-meeting/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Humanitarian success in postwar Iraq is essential",date:"13 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-13-humanitarian-success-in-postwar-iraq-is-essential/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="For GWB\'s re-election as much as anything else" href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001896.html">Humanitarian success in postwar Iraq is essential</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Boltenhagen",date:"13 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-13-boltenhagen/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Just Call Me Ami",date:"13 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-13-just-call-me-ami/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Boltenhagen",date:"13 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-13-boltenhagen/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>On Sunday we visited <a title="Ostseebad Boltenhagen an der Mecklenburgischen Ostseeküste - Mecklenburg" href="http://www.boltenhagen.de/">Boltenhagen</a>, on the Baltic coast between Lübeck and Wismar. It\'s a traditional seaside resort town, celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, very well kept and with a very nice beach. The day was a bit breezy (perfect for the windsurfing competition that happened to be going on), but as relief from the heat we didn\'t mind at all.</p>\n<p>In theory, Boltenhagen would be just 30 minutes past Lübeck. In practice, thanks to bad roads (er, I mean the lack of infrastructure in the \'new states\') and Sunday traffic, it took us <em>2 hours</em> to cover the <a title="Staugefährdete Straßenabschnitte bei Selmsdorf" href="http://verkehrsinformation.mvnet.de/stau/stau4.htm">20 km of 2-lane road</a> from Lübeck to the turn-off to the north. Luckily Christopher held up like a trooper, and the day was not ruined. But all I can say is hurry up and finish the damned Baltic Autobahn A20 already!</p>\n<p>The traffic jam ended in Selmsdorf, the first village east of the former border. Amidst the half-completed housing and the ghost-town commercial park, we noticed a dirt road leading into a gully, with a street sign "Strasse der Freiheit" - Street of Freedom. I wish we had had a camera ready. I guess you can have them build your Street of Freedom, but you have to pave it for yourself.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"European bikers are not wussies",date:"12 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-12-european-bikers-are-not-wussies/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Humanitarian success in postwar Iraq is essential",date:"13 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-13-humanitarian-success-in-postwar-iraq-is-essential/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:655,pageCount:1101}}}});
