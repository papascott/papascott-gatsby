"We stand for the courage to wage peace. But what do the others stand for?"</p>\n<p>I\'m not exactly sure which war the SPD is claiming to have prevented. If they mean Iraq, that certainly didn\'t work, and sticking one\'s head in the sand and pretending a problem doesn\'t exist doesn\'t exactly require courage. What they really mean is "We stood up to Bush", implying that Angela Merkel wouldn\'t have. It\'s a whiff of anti-Americanism, and it will be interesting to see if the SPD takes it any further. </p>\n<p>The other interesting thing is the ruling party chose not to use a photo of their candidate, even though Gerhard Schr√∂der is personally more popular than Merkel. Which party is the challenger here? Then again, it\'s a strange election, where neither party wants to be the incumbant.</p>\n<p>This is one of a series of "What do the others stand for?" slogans... other issues the SPD "stands for" include <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31724237/in/pool-wahl05/">job protection</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ix/31256013/in/pool-wahl05/">reform</a>,  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31131636/in/pool-wahl05/">modern family policy</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31130961/in/pool-wahl05/">social justice</a>.
