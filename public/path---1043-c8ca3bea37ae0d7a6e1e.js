Corporate glossy visions<br />\nof the future... you can already get that at Disneyland, right?<br />\nThankfully, my expectations were not met. We arrived early, stayed<br />\nlate, did not exhaust or bankrupt ourselves, and had a good time. We<br />\ndidn't plan a strategy ahead of time, but looking back, our plan was:</p>\n<p>* Avoid the long lines. There are about 10 major attractions with long<br />\nlines, and we skipped most of them. There are hundreds of things to see<br />\nwithout any line at all. The most spectacular attraction, the 21st<br />\nCentury, has the longest line. If we go again, we'll to rush there<br />\nright at opening time. Hopefully it won't rain next time.</p>\n<p>* Baby carriage accessible? Mostly. We were scared from the lofty<br />\nHolland pavillion by both the line and the many stairs, but most of<br />\nthe halls are handicapped accessible. We carried Christopher into<br />\nseveral smaller exhibits.</p>\n<p>* Lots of rest stops. Christopher was often hungry, thirsty, tired, or<br />\nneeded changing. Don't rush, stay flexible?</p>\n<p>* Hungry? Use connections if you got them (Mama's employer is a<br />\nsponsoring partner of the Expo), or go ethnic. The country booths have<br />\nbetter and cheaper food than the stands outside.</p>\n<p>* Avoid the propaganda. Concentrate on the country booths. </p>\n<p>What did we see? A rather large country in North America was not<br />\nrepresented at all, but we did see Sri Lanka, Australia, Andorra,<br />\nIsrael, Egypt, Malta, Luxembourg, France, United Arab Emeriates,<br />\nLatvia, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Norway, Brazil, Canada, Iceland<br />\n(fron the outside) and Vietnam (for dinner).</p>\n<p>My highlight? Germany.  The pavillion was lavish, well thought out, planned to the last detail, and<br />\nmaybe too perfect, but showed a happy, thoughtful ,prosperous and<br />\ndiverse country that Germany could become. As someone who lives here<br />\nby choice, I hope that's the direction it will really go.</p>\n<p><i><b>One thought I couldn't get out of my mind for a long time last night was \"Why is Germany hosting the EXPO 2000 and therefore the world and can't control the problems with right-wing extremism\"??? I'm ashamed to read headlines like this on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/09/02/german.neo/index.html\">CNN</a>! How many citizens and government officials have looked the other way for years to have come to accept a sort of nationalist sentiment in some Germans! </p>\n<p>I'm very much ashamed of my fellow citizens who are disoriented in their way of thinking. 21 years ago I was an AFS High School Exchange Student in the US and I frequently dealt with questions about the \"German  Conscience\" in relation to the Holocaust. I never thought Right Wing Nationalists would be marching in Germany ever again. </p>\n<p>Suddenly politicians are thinking what can be done to stop this mental disease. I like a proposal from the Socialdemocrat Party: if convicted of right-wing activities your driver's license may be revoked for a minimum of 10 years. That just might be an effective way to give some disoriented young people a moment to think about what they might be about to do!</b></i></p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Expo Day",date:"03 Sep 2000",slug:"/2000-09-03-expo-day/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Happy Anniversary to Us",date:"06 Sep 2000",slug:"/2000-09-06-happy-anniversary-to-us/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Expo Day",date:"03 Sep 2000",slug:"/2000-09-03-expo-day/",tags:"Y2000"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/09/expologo001.gif" height="141" width="140" border="0" alt="Expo Logo: " /></p>\n<p><b><i>The Expo was much better than we expected.
