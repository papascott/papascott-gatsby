Not that I have any real use for an office package, but sometimes you can\'t avoid having to use one. At work we are going to be cutting way back on the number of MS Office licenses (I think down to 20; we have 130 employees). The rest of us will have OpenOffice.</p>',fields:{title:"OpenOffice",date:"11 Oct 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-10-11-openoffice/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-10-11-openoffice/",prev:{fields:{title:"Monsters",date:"11 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-11-monsters/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Seventy-five Percent",date:"12 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-12-seventy-five-percent/"}}}}}});
