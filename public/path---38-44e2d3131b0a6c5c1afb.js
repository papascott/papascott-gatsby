With airports closed, trains running late, and highways clogged throughout Europe, we\'re happy to be staying put for the holidays this year.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>We ended up staying put in April as well (thanks to Icelandic volcanic ash) when we planned to fly to Florida for the McDonald\'s International Convention. Next one is in 2012. We were able to make it to Minnesota in July to see Grandma and Grandpa, with side trips to Arizona and San Francisco. Our fall meeting was in Greece, but we had no time for sightseeing.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>In August we finally celebrated our 25th anniversary (2 years late) with a catered barbecue. We were happy to have Grandma and my cousin here for the festivities.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Our son turns 11 this month and is in the 5th grade. In Germany that means he has graduated to Gymnasium (middle school). To take advantage of smaller classes and more individual attention, he\'s at a private school that\'s a 45 minute bus ride away. This fall he\'s already read the entire Harry Potter series in German and is now half-way through in English. He\'s also developing an interest in music that we\'ll have to make sure we nurture.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Our three restaurants are doing fine (at least when it doesn\'t snow) and keep us both busy. If things go as planned we\'ll open a new restaurant on the Autobahn this summer.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Our present to ourselves this year was a modern wood stove for our living room. It has glass on 3 sides so we can always see the flames (if we keep the glass clean). Luckily we ordered a cord of firewood before the snow started, so we\'re ready for a cold winter!</p></blockquote>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/woodstove.jpg" alt="Wood Stove" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Starting Over",date:"08 Dec 2010",slug:"/2010-12-08-starting-over/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Grocery Shopping",date:"05 Jan 2011",slug:"/2011-01-05-grocery-shopping/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Starting Over",date:"08 Dec 2010",slug:"/2010-12-08-starting-over/",tags:"Y2010"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/04/in-front-of-the-dakota/">Five years ago</a> I wrote this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/8898300/?pageid=rs.NewsArchive&amp;pageregion=mainRegion&amp;rnd=1133704411142&amp;has-player=true" title="RollingStone.com: John Lennon : Lennon Lives Forever : News">It was 25 years ago</a> <strike>Wednesday</strike> Thursday that John Lennon was killed.

Actually, they were in my legs and butt, and I was too dumb to realize they were really coming from my back. And I was too dumber <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/\">to go to a proper orthopedist</a> until 2 months later, who diagnosed a pinched nerve in my lower back, and it took another 2 months of shots and therapy to actually relieve the pain.</p>\n<p>At that time, as a kind of \"it can't do any harm and could do some good\" measure I signed up for a back therapy course at our local fitness center <a href=\"http://www.sportland-buchholz.de/\">Sportland in Buchholz</a>, with a group mostly 20+ years my senior. Part of the course was a back-strength check from <a href=\"http://www.dr-wolff.de/\">Dr. Wolff</a>, and my values were at first well in the red. Eight weeks later I had barely made it into the yellow area, so I had some work ahead of me.</p>\n<p>Of course I lapsed in my training, so exactly one year after my first episode I suffered a relapse of my back pain, which unfortunately coincided with two trans-Atlantic flights. Eight hours of sitting in a plane with a pinched nerve can only be a special level of hell never imagined by Dante.</p>\n<p>I mention all this now only because for the past year I've been more or less consistent with my training (mostly less), and just re-took the Dr. Wolff back-strength test. My strength values were all green. My triceps are somewhat weak, and my left side is stronger than my right, but the absolute values are OK. And I haven't felt any symptoms of back pain in nearly 3 years. Having gone through that hell, I'm happy not to have to deal with it again.</p>\n<p>My weight isn't yet optimal, and that plays a big factor as well. But it's gotten better. I weighed 106 kg when my back problems began, and I'm at 93 kg now. I'm still above my ideal BMI, but I'm much better than I was.</p>\n<p>Back pain is one of the major health problems in middle age. I've been able to beat it by reducing my weight and increasing my back strength. That strategy could work for others as well.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"I Live Overseas...
