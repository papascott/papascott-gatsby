The Scottish bagpipe. And wear a kilt. At first we thought it was just a phase, and we laughed it off. And ignored it.</p>\n<p>But our son kept insisting. And looking up bagpipes on the internet. And kilts. So my wife and I decided to swallow our prejudices about bagpipes, and got him a \"starter kit\" for his birthday in December. It turns out to learn bagpipe you don't actually play a bagpipe for the first year or so, since it's rather complicated to keep the bag full of air and play music at the same time. You start out by learning the notes with a \"practice chanter\", which resembles the fingering part of the bagpipe and has a similar reed. It looks like a recorder, but takes a whole lot more air to play, and at first it sounds like a duck call.</p>\n<p>But after a few days with the chanter, the book, and the CD he started playing actual notes. And he kept at it. So we started to look around for someone to teach lessons. That's not quite as easy as with more common instruments, where you can sign up at the local music store. You have to do some looking around. At <a href=\"http://www.dudelsackkurse.de/\">http://www.dudelsackkurse.de/</a> we found Herbert Bartmann in Oldenburg who offers a day-long beginners course on weekends, and read that 12 is the perfect age to start learning. Oldenburg is an hour drive each way, somewhat impractical for weekly lessons, but I brought him in for the day course.</p>\n<p>We found that we were on the right track for getting started. Our son could play the scale and read notes by now, and after 8 hours with Mr. Bartmann was even more excited to learn more. He helped us make contact with a teacher in Hamburg, and we've had two lessons with him so far. It looks like our adventure will continue.</p>\n<p>As a lay person listening in on the lessons, I've found the bagpipe to be more interesting than I imagined, particularly how one works within the limitations of the instrument. Its range is limited (9 notes, a little more than an octave), has a constant volume (no way to play quietly), and has a constant, uninterrupted tone. All the music is in the fingering, with grace notes and doublings surrounding the individual notes.</p>\n<p>Our son's goal is to play a bagpipe solo at his school's Christmas concert… this year would be a little soon, but 2013 is certainly an attainable goal. We'll see then if he's still serious about the kilt.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"End of the Century - 50% Loaded",date:"09 Feb 2012",slug:"/2012-02-09-end-of-the-century-50-loaded/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"MacMini Media Center",date:"18 Mar 2012",slug:"/2012-03-18-macmini-media-center/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"End of the Century - 50% Loaded",date:"09 Feb 2012",slug:"/2012-02-09-end-of-the-century-50-loaded/",tags:"Y2012"},html:'<p><object style="height: 390px; width: 640px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kJizV-d3sEQ?version=3&feature=player_detailpage"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kJizV-d3sEQ?version=3&feature=player_detailpage" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="480" height="360"></object></p>\n<p>Happy Birthday to me!</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"It's Still Raining",date:"13 Jan 2012",slug:"/2012-01-13-its-still-raining/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Our Adventure with the Bagpipe",date:"16 Mar 2012",slug:"/2012-03-16-our-adventure-with-the-bagpipe/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"It's Still Raining",date:"13 Jan 2012",slug:"/2012-01-13-its-still-raining/",tags:"Y2012"},html:"<p>An inside joke in our house is that if I answer the phone and right after the \"Hello\" start discussing the weather, my wife knows my parents in Minnesota have called. Never mind the Caller ID and the fact I'm speaking English are also dead giveaways.</p>\n<p>Of course in Minnesota the weather is a valid topic for conversation. It's extreme! They've got bitter cold, sweltering heat, massive thunderstorms, killer blizzards, and (insert your own adjective here) tornados! If you're not careful the weather can kill you! Drivers are advised to keep blankets and chocolate in their cars, since if they get stuck in the snow on a country road it could take a day or two or three before they can get out. My father was a highway engineer, responsible for keeping roads clear. He spent half his career watching the weather and planning accordingly. And in retirement, he hasn't quite gotten out of the habit. :-)</p>\n<p>If Minnesota weather is worth a conversation, Hamburg weather is worth at best a grunt. Maritime climate. 130 days of rain per year. Moderate temperatures. Regular seasons. Sometimes wind. Hmmph.</p>\n<p>(There are sometimes exceptions, of course, like in 2010 when we had snow and ice on the ground for 3 months: January, February and December. Those months stick out like sore thumbs on our business statements. It's not that it was so cold, but that the highway departments ran out of salt and couldn't clear the roads. They should have called my father for advice.)</p>\n<p>For instance, the past 3 weeks we've had rain and 4°C/40°F, broken up only by days with wind and rain. The damp cold seeps through your clothing and sticks to your skin. If you're prone to depression due to seasonal affective disorder, this is not the place to be. </p>\n<p>So when my parents call and tell me about the latest extreme phenomenon they are experiencing, they always ask politely how the weather is here. My answer is pretty much always the same. It's still raining.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Alarm Clocks",date:"11 Jan 2012",slug:"/2012-01-11-alarm-clocks/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"End of the Century - 50% Loaded",date:"09 Feb 2012",slug:"/2012-02-09-end-of-the-century-50-loaded/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:26,pageCount:1101}}}});
