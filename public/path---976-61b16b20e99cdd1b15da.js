The pictures we saw, pictures of innocent victims, of aggression and destruction,will remain in our minds forever. We grieve for all people who lost their lives. Our thoughts are with their families who lost their daughters, sons, mothers and fathers. All of them have our deepest sympathy. Many years ago a magnanimous United States of America helped the German nation to free itself of its darkest past. The President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, brought us hope when he said during a time of need:  Ich bin ein Berliner.  Today we say to the American people: <b>We stand by you!</b>" This message took up the entire back page of today\'s issue. Readers were asked to hang it as a poster in windows, shop windows and cars as a sign of grief and support for the US.  </p>\n<p>Süddeutsche: <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/aktuell/sz/artikel77054.php"><b>Heute sind wir alle Amerikaner</b></a>. </p>\n<p>FAZ: <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=&#123;B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88&#125;&doc=&#123;7586AE23-FEC0-4683-906F-3B0351D88C3C&#125;">Germans March, Mourn After Terror Attacks</a> "Today we are all Americans," said Peter Struck, the parliamentary group leader of the Social Democrats.</p>\n<p>German President Rau: "We Germans, especially in Berlin, have so much for which to thank America."</p>\n<p>One trail of the hijackers <a href="http://us.news2.yimg.com/f/42/31/7m/dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010912/us/germany_attacks_investigation_1.html">leads to Hamburg</a>.

He was reading the web page of the <a href="http://www.tagesschau.de">Tagesschau</a>, the ARD TV news broadcast. A plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. I tried to find information on the web, but all news sites, American, German and otherwise, were jammed. I finally saw a first picture at <a href="http://www.focus.de">Focus</a>, and the first posts at <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. We set up a TV room to show the news broadcasts. Mama called from her car. She had caught the tail end of a news report on the radio, and couldn\'t believe what she thought she had heard.</p>\n<p>I decided to leave work early, even though I had started late. Outside the rain was a deluge, the gutters were flooding, traffic was slow. <a href="//www.ndr4.de">NDR4</a> radio was reporting what they could see on TV, what the correspondent in NY could see out the window, the towers were collapsing, debate in the Bundestag was cancelled, members of parliament were milling together with visitors in the lobby watching the news broadcasts. </p>\n<p>Mama was home, the television offered pictures but no new information. Christopher was hyperactive, totally beside himself, as if he were breathing the tension in the air. Our satellite dish is on the fritz, can\'t get CNN at all, have to rely on the main stations. Chancellor Schröder spoke of \'unqualified solidarity\' with the US, which made me feel reassured. Otherwise I just feel numb. I miss an eloqent President, who can express what I and the nation must feel, but cannot put into words.</p>\n<p>Mama shed some tears. Perhaps she had started to fathom what has happened. I haven\'t. Not yet.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Stomachache",date:"11 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-11-stomachache/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"We're In This Together",date:"13 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-13-were-in-this-together/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Stomachache",date:"11 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-11-stomachache/",tags:"Y2001"},html:'<p>It\'s nice to see all the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/news/2001/09/10">improvements</a> being made to Manila recently.</p>\n<p>I\'m serious about getting an SQL version of the weblogs.com data online.
