Workers rejected the salary rejection proposal from management, and since there there has been official silence. We know the investor insists on cost cuts and he maintains that our developer salaries are too high (hint, hint). Rumor has it that management is not taking the hint and will be making cuts in non-productive departments (i.e. everythng <em>but</em> development). The rumor is that sysadmins will be reduced by 50%. If that's the case, then staying would probably be worse than leaving. :-)</p>\n<p>We should know for sure in a week or two. Our employment contracts can be terminated 6 weeks before quarter's end, so the next deadline is Thursday, 19 August. The Betriebsrat must be informed of layoffs a week ahead of time. Social criteria must be taken into account when deciding on layoffs, so age, marital status, and number of children matter more than longevity or skills. So if you want to keep your job, don't bother with extra training... start having kids!</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The latest rumor is that the last rumor is untrue, and that no sysadmins will be laid off this quarter. So who knows what is really up? Tune in next week... same bat-time, same bat-channel!</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"UnNice Titles",date:"02 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-02-unnice-titles/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Blogg Topping",date:"03 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-03-blogg-topping/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"UnNice Titles",date:"02 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-02-unnice-titles/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>Is anyone else annoyed as hell by <a href="http://philringnalda.com/">sites</a> that <a href="http://bradchoate.com/">implement</a> so-called <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/">Nice titles</a>?
