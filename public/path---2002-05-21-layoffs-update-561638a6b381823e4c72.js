They were not communicated in one-to-one meetings, as one would expect, but instead dropped anonymously into the employees' home mailboxes on Friday afternoon. And this is supposed to motivate us remaining employees to pull ourselves out of the crisis? Hardly. Stay-at-home fatherhood is looking better all the time.
