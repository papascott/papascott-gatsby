I\'m no Asian business expert, but I do pay attention to the news, and can point out a few random facts.</p>\n<p>The <a title="Ostasiatischer Verein e.V." href="http://www.oav.de/index.php3?t=e">German Asia-Pacific Business Association</a> is based in Hamburg and is extremely active developing business contacts in China and elsewhere in Asia. It was founded in 1900. Business relations with China are not a new thing in Germany.</p>\n<p>In 1984 Volkswagen signed a 50% 25-year joint venture with China. It was this year <a href="http://www.canadiandriver.com/news/020415-2.htm">extended</a> for an additional 20 years. I believe that the US Big 3 thought that 50% was too little control to be successful.</p>\n<p>Hamburg, Germany\'s largest port, is a sister city with Shanghai, China\'s largest port. The mayor visits Shanghai annually, with a large business delegation. 230 Chinese firms are located in Hamburg.</p>\n<p>In the end, I think German business is successful in China because, at least in regards to China,  Germans put business before politics. I don\'t think Americans would be able to do that.</p>',fields:{title:"Chinese Beetles",date:"22 Dec 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-12-22-chinese-beetles/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-12-22-chinese-beetles/",prev:{fields:{title:"Old Wine in New Bottles",date:"21 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-21-old-wine-in-new-bottles/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Christmas Garlic",date:"23 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-23-christmas-garlic/"}}}}}});
