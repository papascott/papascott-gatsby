Fridays are extra challenging since the dinner hours are (along with Sunday evenings) the busiest hours of the week, and the closing shift doesn\'t come in until 8:30 pm because of the longer hours on weekends. This particular Friday we had back luck with crew calling in sick. We actually had two people less for dinner rush than for the mid-afternoon.</p>\n<p>Also on this particular Friday was the first school vacation weekend in Hamburg, Harley Days in Hamburg, and the first good weather in two weeks. Between 6 and 8 pm it was like getting rolled over with a steam roller. We literally had lines out the door, and I could only open 2 registers. The customers were patient and good natured, but we could have done a lot more business. Thanks to the good weather, most of them sat outside.</p>\n<p>Good for us, most of our closers came early and punched in a quarter to eight. We then had 2 more registers, and could send 2 people to the lobby. Checking our hourly sales, we just missed our projection from 7 to 8 pm, but the PC said we had 4.5 too few crew. Considering that 4 people punched in at 7:45 pm, we were then at least five people short before they arrived. We had 9 plus me, we should have had 14.</p>\n<p><a href="http://lumma.de/">Nico</a> and <a href="http://sibylle.blogg.de/">Sibylle</a> and family came in about 7:45 pm, just as things were starting to settle down. Other than the question "Is it always this full?" they seemed pleased with the service, and Frauke said that <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3514">the picture Nico took of me</a> "doesn\'t look all that bad" considering the previous two hours. Sibylle noted that the child seats don\'t have straps and it is too easy for an active toddler like <a href="http://sibylle.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=490">Henri</a> to crawl out. I\'ll pass that along to the boss. And maybe we can do a guided tour next time.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Google Saved Our Morning Coffee",date:"14 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-14-google-saved-our-morning-coffee/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Tostedt HRB 200842",date:"18 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-18-tostedt-hrb-200842/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Google Saved Our Morning Coffee",date:"14 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-14-google-saved-our-morning-coffee/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p>Now more than ever, our morning coffee is a vital necessity in order to start the day. So it was with no small amount of horror that we discovered yesterday that our <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/24/jura-xf50/">Jura coffee machine</a> would no longer produce coffee. The beans would grind, the water would pump, but only a few drops of hot brown elixir would trickle into our cups. No error message was displayed, and the problem persisted even after changing the water filter and running the cleaning program twice.</p>\n<p>Then came Google to the rescue. Searching for "Jura selbst reparieren" (repair Jura yourself) brought up the site <a href="http://www.biomess.de/jura/index.html">"Selber schrauben an Jura"</a>, where we found that a <a href="http://www.biomess.de/jura/html/faq.html">common problem</a> (FAQ 15) is that the brew filter becomes clogged. It can be easily cleaned with your finger after reaching with your hand through the tray opening.</p>\n<p>Now if Google would only brew the coffee for us every morning as well, it would be almost worth all the private data they are collecting from us.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Ten Days In",date:"11 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-11-ten-days-in/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Minus Five",date:"15 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-15-minus-five/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Ten Days In",date:"11 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-11-ten-days-in/",tags:"Y2007"},html:"<p>Sorry for the relative silence here. Sixty-hour work weeks (40+ in the store plus office work at home) put a real crimp in your blogging. I can't really complain to my boss, though, she's working even more.</p>\n<p>We're very happy with the first 10 days. We took over a wonderful crew and management team that is intelligent and motivated. We're investing our crew labor costs by increasing staffing on all shifts, and we're already seeing above-market sales increases. If you staff it, they will come. </p>\n<p>We've been able to add 5 new employees to our crew of 39, but we need more (we're losing some crew when the new school year and apprenticeship terms start in August). And we need to start adding employees now for the sales increases we expect with McCaf√© in December.</p>\n<p>On the personal side, what's new for us is that we need to coordinate our home life with Christopher. Once or twice a week we can bring him for a \"shift\" at the restaurant for an hour or two, but no more than that. Since I've worked home office the past 3 years, we have to readjust to the same problems all working parents face. For his part, Christopher has been very good about the sudden change in our routine. He's very excited about summer school vacation and our (his and mine) visit to Grandma and Grandpa in Minnesota in two weeks.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Here is Your Receipt",date:"09 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-09-here-is-your-receipt/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Google Saved Our Morning Coffee",date:"14 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-14-google-saved-our-morning-coffee/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:115,pageCount:1101}}}});
