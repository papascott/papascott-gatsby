Luckily Christopher was outside, and she sent him to the house to get me. With our neighbors' help, we took her to the local emergency room. There in very uncaring fashion they took x-rays and sent her home with crutches, pain pills, and instructions keep the ankle iced and to visit her doctor on Monday. Our other neighbor is a physical therapist, and she was able to offer massage and some advice in a more caring manner. Remind us to have our next accident <em>away</em> from home.</p>\n<p>She will likely be off work at least a week, since she can't drive without her right foot. We'll see how organizing getting Christopher to and from day care will work out.</p>",fields:{title:"Injured Reserve",date:"18 Jan 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-01-18-injured-reserve/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-01-18-injured-reserve/",prev:{fields:{title:"Back In Touch",date:"18 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-18-back-in-touch/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Diagnosis T14.3",date:"20 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-20-diagnosis-t143/"}}}}}});
