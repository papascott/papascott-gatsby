They\'ve had a long hard journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, but now they are just centimeters away from their goal. Christopher placed them on the kitchen table two weeks ago, and every day has moved them closer to the nativity scene near the back door. Two nights ago they were on the TV set. Today they made it on top of the radiator.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2131498374" title="View \'CIMG0411\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2305/2131498374_49a929442f.jpg" alt="CIMG0411" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>Here\'s wishing all of our readers that you find whatever you\'re looking for this season, even if it takes a two week journey from the kitchen table to the radiator.
