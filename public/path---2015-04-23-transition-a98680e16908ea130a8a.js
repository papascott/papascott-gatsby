Behind the scenes it looks a <em>lot</em> different. After over a decade of blogging on WordPress (I actually started using its predecessor <a href="http://cafelog.com/">B2</a> in 2002), I\'m now on the static site generator jekyll. My posts have been exported to text files. No more mysql database, no PHP, no more web interface. </p>\n<p>So everything is new and things are still broken. I don\'t have all posts imported yet, I\'m only back to 2012 and not 1999 when this thing started. There are a lot a worthless one-line posts from the olden days, since back then we didn\'t have Twitter and Facebook yet for worthless posts. So I have some work to do. But I\'m looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>The design, however, is absolutely fabulous, even on mobile, and for that I can take absolutely no credit. It\'s the <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">lanyon</a> theme for jekyll by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>, who co-wrote (Twitter) <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and I thank him for making his work available to us mere mortals. </p>',fields:{title:"Transition",date:"23 Apr 2015",url:"https://papascott.de/2015-04-23-transition/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2015-04-23-transition/",prev:{fields:{title:"Confirmation",date:"20 Apr 2015",slug:"/2015-04-20-confirmation/"}},next:{fields:{title:"See What Sticks",date:"30 Apr 2015",slug:"/2015-04-30-see-what-sticks/"}}}}}});
