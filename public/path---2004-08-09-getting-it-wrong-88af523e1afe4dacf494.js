It\'s about to get worse." Thousands of cases spanning decades are to be audited in Harris County, TX, a "jurisdiction (which) has produced more executions than any other county in America". This is why I don\'t like the death penalty, or Guantanamo, or the more draconian parts of the war on terror. It\'s not just that I think they\'re immoral; that, after all, can be a legitimate point of contention. I just don\'t trust the government at any level to be competent. That goes for any government, not just in the US.</p>\n<p>And not just for crime and terror. We could just as well be talking about Hartz IV and Agenda 2010 in Germany.</p>',fields:{title:"Getting It Wrong",date:"09 Aug 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-08-09-getting-it-wrong/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-08-09-getting-it-wrong/",prev:{fields:{title:'Die deutsche "Recht"schreibung',date:"08 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-08-die-deutsche-rechtschreibung/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Nick of Time",date:"09 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-09-nick-of-time/"}}}}}});
