Come on in! </p>\n<p>Wörme, where Andrea\'s cousin lives, is literally within walking distance from us (at leasfor Germans, I don\'t think most Americans would walk that far). Wörme has a 50-year old <a href="http://www.bgn-demeter.de/hof_woerme_uk.html">organic farm</a>, an antique small-gauge train (<a href="http://www.wilde-erika.de/"><i>Die Wilde Erika</i></a>) with 1 km of track, a nice patch of <i>Heide</i> (heather) called the Busenbachtal, and a kiosk that caused a lawsuit because it is technically in a residential area. All this in village smaller than Lüllau!</p>\n<p>Christopher seems to have caught a cold, which explains why he was in a bad mood yesterday. He\'s wheezing and coughing, has little appetite, but no fever. I was able to pick him up early this afternoon, and he\'ll spend a quiet day at home tomorrow with Mama. He\'s actually pretty happy at the moment, as long as he can hold a telephone of some sort.</p>',fields:{title:"Excuse Us, Please",date:"30 Jan 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-01-30-excuse-us-please/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-01-30-excuse-us-please/",prev:{fields:{title:"Sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes the bear eats you",date:"29 Jan 2001",slug:"/2001-01-29-sometimes-you-eat-the-bear-and-sometimes-the-bear-eats-you/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Energy",date:"01 Feb 2001",slug:"/2001-02-01-energy/"}}}}}});
