That program is actually for a 10K, so the 5K at the Stadtlauf should be a piece of cake (although it's on asphalt and might be hot), right? The program calls for 3 runs a week, however I'm cheating a bit by sticking to every other day. As a result I'm already on Week 9.</p>\n<p>I actually did the 5K at the Stadtlauf in 2010, but I didn't train sufficiently or correctly and <s>nearly died</s> was very sore the following week. My run yesterday was 55 minutes (with 3 1-minute walking breaks) and nearly 7K and I felt fine (slow pace with pulse in the 130s the entire time). The Stadtlauf should go just fine. And the 10K training won't go to waste, I'm intending to keep it up for the <a href=\"http://volkslauf.vfl-jesteburg.de/\">Volkslauf in Jesteburg</a> in September (through woods in fall weather).</p>\n<p>On the days I don't run I've been working out at the fitness center, so except for one day last week when I hurt my foot I've been doing fitness everyday for 8 weeks, since the week before Easter. And I have the results to show for it. I've lost a further 3 kg in the meantime, my weight is at 90.x (sounds like a radio station frequency), and my body fat is down too. My goals are 89.x by the end of June and 84.x by the end of September.  </p>\n<p>This was also a test of <a href=\"http://fargo.io/\">fargo.io</a> for posting to WordPress.

Or maybe "re-discover" is the better word, since for all we know we already knew all the things that annoy us about our partner but had conveniently forgotten them.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, salt. My mother is a health-conscious nurse, so even in the \'70s when I was growing up we didn\'t eat a lot of salt. She always cooked with a herbal mixture to replace salt. I never got in the habit of adding salt at the table, and don\'t think of a salt shaker as an essential piece of cutlery.</p>\n<p>My wife, on the other hand, will salt everything, often without tasting it first (especially if I have cooked it). She gets nervous if she sits at the table and there is not a salt shaker within reach. We sometimes have 3 or 4 salt shakers on the table at one time, since she often brings one to the table herself to make sure there\'s one there. And by my observation, her use of salt is moderate compared to some in her family and in Germany in general. I sometimes think that the heavy use of salt can so deaden the taste buds that one forgets food can have taste other than salt.</p>\n<p>So when my nutrition class mentioned that cutting down on salt was not only healthy, but good for weight loss, I had no problems putting that into effect for myself. It however opened up a new source of conflict. I would cook a healthy dish without salt, my wife would grimace and reach for the salt shaker, I would roll my eyes, and our entertainment was guaranteed for the rest of the meal.</p>\n<p><img src="/assets/gefro-040413.png" alt="Gefro DiÃ¤twurze" class=\'alignright\' />Some peace has been restored to our household through the use of a salt substitute (which, strangely enough, is <a href="http://www.myline24.de/shop/essen-trinken/gefro-produktwelt/gefro-di%C3%A4tw%C3%BCrze-und-di%C3%A4tsuppe">sold</a> by the publisher of the nutrition class). It\'s based on potassium chloride, and tastes something like chicken soup. </p>\n<p>It doesn\'t work that well at the table, though. The last time my wife asked me to pass the salt (which I had conveniently placed at the opposite end of the table from her), I instead handed her a newspaper article with the headline <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article114765123/Millionen-Tote-durch-zu-hohen-Salzkonsum.html">"Millions of deaths from excessive salt consumption"</a>. Just my way of saying I love you, honey! (And after she threw the newspaper in my face, I handed her the salt.)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Back to the Grind",date:"02 Apr 2013",slug:"/2013-04-02-back-to-the-grind/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Grinding it out",date:"20 May 2013",slug:"/2013-05-20-grinding-it-out/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:17,pageCount:1101}}}});
