It\'s written in Perl and available (among other things) as a <a href="http://www.movabletype.org" title="Movable Type">MT</a> plugin. I\'m trying it out with this post. It\'s designed to leave the plain text very readable after it\'s marked up, as opposed to <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/" title="by Dean Allen">Textile</a>, which makes marking up plain text easy but is leaves the plain text less than readable. Markdown might come in handy for text maintained by less web-savvy colleagues, or for quickly marking up text from web-unfriendly sources (like Microsoft Word). I\'ll try it out for a few posts.</p>\n<p>(The MTEntry tag <code>convert_breaks</code> seems to be incompatible with Markdown. I\'ve removed it from my templates for now, and if I keep using Markdown I\'ll figure out another way to get my entry title and my permalink on the same line as the entry body.)</p>',fields:{title:"Markdown",date:"21 Mar 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-03-21-markdown/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-03-21-markdown/",prev:{fields:{title:"Gordon",date:"21 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-21-gordon/"}},next:{fields:{title:"The Spinger Telegraph?",date:"21 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-21-the-spinger-telegraph/"}}}}}});
