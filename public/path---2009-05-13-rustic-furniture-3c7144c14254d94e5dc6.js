Today we got rid of the last remaining bits of American furniture we had brought with us back in 1990. It was a bulky oak dining room set that Germans would politely describe as "rustic". We had tried selling it a few years ago, but found no takers. It\'s been in the basement since then, and as part of our long-term 2009 basement project it landed on the pile of "Sperrm&uuml;ll" that was to be picked up today.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, how would one refer to "Sperrm&uuml;ll" pickup in English? My father would call it the "dray service", but that\'s a quaint 19th century term that\'s a bit of an inside joke in our family. "Junk pickup" &agrave; la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_and_Son">Sanford &amp; Son</a> maybe?)</p>\n<p>However, the furniture will not end up at the dump. The table was picked up a couple weeks ago by a flea-market collector whom we had called to take a look at our stuff. And the 4 chairs disappeared from the pile on the street yesterday, one day before today\'s pickup. Sperrm&uuml;ll moves in mysterious ways.</p>',fields:{title:"Rustic furniture",date:"13 May 2009",url:"https://papascott.de/2009-05-13-rustic-furniture/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2009-05-13-rustic-furniture/",prev:{fields:{title:"Politically Active",date:"11 May 2009",slug:"/2009-05-11-politically-active/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Hybrid Fryer",date:"27 May 2009",slug:"/2009-05-27-hybrid-fryer/"}}}}}});
