It might be for MamaMaus, although the form has clealy 'Frau' and 'Firma' crossed-out, so that the letter is for 'Herrn Hanson-Petersen' (which isn't me, there's no Petersen in my name, but that's beside the poinrt).  The last registered letter we received was for her, a speeding ticket (with fine and points). The US consulate sent my passport via registered mail. A pink slip from my employer might be registered, but the deadline for layoffs has passed for this quarter. Financial documents might also be sent registered.</p>\n<p>Now I am expecting a <a title=\"PapaScott: (Not) Changing Religions\" href=\"http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/23/2712.php\">package</a> to arrive COD, and that would involve the same form being left in our mailbox, except that the 'COD' box would be ticked instead of that for 'Registered Mail'. I assume the post knows how to fill out their own forms. So I have no idea what to expect. It's probably not good news. It's either bad or indifferent. I'll let you know, unless the whole thing is too personal or embarassing. Then I won't.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Script for a new Jagermeister commercial?",date:"27 Nov 2003",slug:"/2003-11-27-script-for-a-new-jagermeister-commercial/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Sweets and flowers",date:"29 Nov 2003",slug:"/2003-11-29-sweets-and-flowers/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Script for a new Jagermeister commercial?",date:"27 Nov 2003",slug:"/2003-11-27-script-for-a-new-jagermeister-commercial/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="She pours two shots.
