That reminds me of my first sports experience in Hamburg. In the fall of 1990, I ventured alone to the Volksparkstadion to watch <a href="http://www.hsv.de/">HSV</a> play Frankfurt, and was disgusted at how the Hamburg fans grunted like monkeys every time the black Frankfurt striker touched the ball. I\'ve never seen HSV since, and still hold a mild distain for HSV and their fans. But I only rarely make fun of children whose parents make them wear HSV gear. Only rarely. But more often when HSV is doing poorly.</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, that black striker was Anthony Yeboah, who later in his career played for... you guessed it, HSV.</p>',fields:{title:"Monkey Noises",date:"25 Nov 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-11-25-monkey-noises/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-11-25-monkey-noises/",prev:{fields:{title:"Horse",date:"25 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-25-horse/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Stillstand",date:"27 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-27-stillstand/"}}}}}});
