Of course, lantern marches only involve open flames and songs vaguely related to astrology, which is nowhere near as exciting as collecting sackloads of candy in while dressed in gruesome costumes. Germans do that stuff for Karnival in late winter... well, at least in Cologne and DÃ¼sseldorf.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"NPR Berlin",date:"28 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-28-npr-berlin/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Expat Pitfalls",date:"31 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-31-expat-pitfalls/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"NPR Berlin",date:"28 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-28-npr-berlin/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p>As <a href="http://www.anglofritz.com/2006/10/the_new_voice_of_america.html">reported by Anglofritz</a>, National Public Radio is now <a href="http://www.npr.org/worldwide/berlin/">broadcasting in Berlin</a> on the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/12/business/radio13.php">old Voice of America</a> frequency (104.1 FM). <a href="http://www.npr.org/worldwide/nprworldwide.html">Most programming</a> comes live from the US with a 6 hour time difference.

This entry explains the differences between an American "letter of reference" and a German <em>"Zeugnis"</em>. A <em>Zeugnis</em> is required by law to be positive (at least on the surface), but there are a number code phrases that can be used to express negative opinions. I knew about many of these, but until now I was not aware of the danger of "demonstrating sensitivity to the needs" of my co-workers, and certainly not of the greater danger of showing <em>comprehensive</em> sensitivity.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"20 km Detour for a Red Light",date:"28 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-28-20-km-detour-for-a-red-light/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"NPR Berlin",date:"28 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-28-npr-berlin/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:182,pageCount:1101}}}});
