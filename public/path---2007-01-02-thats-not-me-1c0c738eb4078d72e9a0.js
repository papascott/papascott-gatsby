Christopher had school vacation, and he got a lot of new CDs for Christmas and his birthday. I ripped them all into my <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html">Squeezebox</a>, and we listened to them all. And, the <a href="http://slimscrobbler.sourceforge.net/">scrobbler plugin for the Squeezebox</a> sent all the titles to last.fm. Good thing MamaMaus has never learned to use the Squeezebox, otherwise my taste would be even more skewed.</p>\n<p>I guess lists like my last.fm profile or my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/">recommendations from Amazon</a> are too stupid to realize when I\'m listening (or buying) for someone else.</p>',fields:{title:"That's Not Me!",date:"02 Jan 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-01-02-thats-not-me/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-01-02-thats-not-me/",prev:{fields:{title:"I now declare this bazaar opened",date:"31 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-31-i-now-declare-this-bazaar-opened/"}},next:{fields:{title:"A one-liner worth 1000 words",date:"03 Jan 2007",slug:"/2007-01-03-a-one-liner-worth-1000-words/"}}}}}});
