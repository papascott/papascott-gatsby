The Sharan was way too big for us. We thought we could use the extra space for our business, but in the 3 years we transported 8 passengers exactly one time. In that same time had to replace bumpers 3 times (twice my fault, once my wife\'s) because the Sharan so damn wide you\'re scraping something before you know it. In that sense, good riddance. </p>\n<p>We\'re on good terms with our local Volkswagen dealer, and we decided to downsize to the newest member of the VW line, the <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-volkswagen-sportwagen-golf-variant-first-drive-review">Golf Variant</a>, a station wagon. It was released in September, we ordered right away, and took delivery at the end of January (that is, today). </p>\n<p>Now, my wife gets a lot more excited about cars than I. She\'ll study the web sites and the specs to find exactly what she wants. For me, a car is simply a vehicle to take me from A to B. She\'s excited about the new car and what it can do. I\'m just happy that it\'s smaller and we\'re less likely to tear off a bumper.</p>\n<p>And I hope that choice is right because the lease is for another three years.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Five Pounds of Post",date:"03 Jan 2014",slug:"/2014-01-03-five-pounds-of-post/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"B-52's",date:"09 Feb 2014",slug:"/2014-02-09-b-52s/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Five Pounds of Post",date:"03 Jan 2014",slug:"/2014-01-03-five-pounds-of-post/",tags:"Y2014"},html:'<p><a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo1.jpg"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo1.jpg" alt="Five Pounds of Post" width="450" height="337" class="size-full wp-image-17540" /></a></p>\n<p>Here\'s a week\'s worth of documents, weighing in at 2.4 kg, for our accountant, in case you\'ve wondered if we\'ve done any work over the holidays.
