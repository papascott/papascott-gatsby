We did end up getting a <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/imac/\">TFT iMac</a> for our QM department. (It arrived within 24 hours, so I guess Apple is indeed having trouble selling them. And why did it come with only OS 9.2 installed?). My question: <b>Are there any web resources for PC/Unix admins adding the first Mac to their network?</b> I find plenty of infos for <i>users</i> switching to Macs, but not for PC admins who now have a new beast in their menagerie. (I do know about <a href=\"http://diveintoosx.org/\">Dive Into OSX</a>, but that seems to be for experienced Mac admins.)</p>",fields:{title:"We're Still Here, and Another Mac Question",date:"03 Jul 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-07-03-were-still-here-and-another-mac-question/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-07-03-were-still-here-and-another-mac-question/",prev:{fields:{title:"When In Doubt.
