That\'s a cause we can agree with, but taking up an entire Saturday with a bus trip to Hannover? And, yes, Christopher insisted on taking the bus.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3517884980" title="View \'photo-4\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3322/3517884980_ca57ec61bb_m.jpg" alt="photo-4" border="0" width="" height="" align="left" /></a>I was not in on the promise, having taken the time to read the fine print. I did however bring to two of them to the bus pick-up point at 9:30 Saturday morning. We managed to get Christopher to compromise on taking the bus there, but to take the train back.</p>\n<p>And they had a good crowd. 10000 demonstrators (mostly teachers and students) <a href="http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/10.000-demonstrieren-gegen-Schulpolitik">protested plans to impose a shortened Abitur in the "Gesamtschule"</a> (combined schools, like we hope to have built in Jesteburg) and the general lack of funding for education.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3517074111" title="View \'photo-5\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3611/3517074111_b02fc60699_m.jpg" alt="photo-5" border="0" width="" height="" align="right" /></a>Frauke and Christopher skipped out after two hours, eating lunch at McDonald\'s amd taking the ICE back home. They were back by 4 pm, giving Christopher plenty of time to mow the lawn before dark and letting Frauke relax a little bit on her day off and enjoy an outdoor cook-out by yours truly. </p>\n<p>The following day was Mother\'s Day, and Frauke celebrated by doing something she loves... planting flowers, in this case at her restaurant at Hamburg Winsener Strasse. </p>',fields:{title:"Politically Active",date:"11 May 2009",url:"https://papascott.de/2009-05-11-politically-active/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2009-05-11-politically-active/",prev:{fields:{title:"East German Nostalgia",date:"06 May 2009",slug:"/2009-05-06-east-german-nostalgia/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Rustic furniture",date:"13 May 2009",slug:"/2009-05-13-rustic-furniture/"}}}}}});
