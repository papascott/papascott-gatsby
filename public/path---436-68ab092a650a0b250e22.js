Another wave of malware in the pipe">a plump phishing attempt</a> to obtain online banking passwords got me wondering. Why haven\'t I heard of anyone phishing for German banking passwords? There are, after all, a few million online banking customers in Germany. Probably because a password alone wouldn\'t get you very far. Ever since the days of 300 baud and Bildschirmtext, German banks have required both a PIN (general password) and a TAN (one-time transaction code) to conduct any business. It\'s inconvenient, and not 100% safe (nothing is), but better than relying on a password alone.</p>\n<p>The modern version of the TAN is the mobile TAN. Your register your cell phone number with the bank. When you make a transaction, the screen gives you a number to call within 90 seconds. You call in with your cell phone, the incoming number is recognized, and the transaction is approved. They are no less safe than normal TANs, and easier to use on the road.</p>\n<p>I mention the mobile TANs also because they are something my employer developed for the German Postbank. The project manager thought it would be cute to integrate mobile TANs into our bugtracker, the open source <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org">Mantis</a> (want a patch? get an mTAN!), so the past few days I\'ve been playing with a web service client under PHP. Cute, as I said, but not particularly useful.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Ooops I Did It Again",date:"10 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-10-ooops-i-did-it-again/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"WindowsXP-KB835935-SP2-DEU.exe",date:"10 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-10-windowsxp-kb835935-sp2-deuexe/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Ooops I Did It Again",date:"10 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-10-ooops-i-did-it-again/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/08/im_zweifel_soli.html" title="Davids Medienkritik: Candlelight Vigils and Mourning in Solidarity / Lichterketten und solidarische Trauer">My latest translation for Davids Medienkritik</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Nick of Time",date:"09 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-09-nick-of-time/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Phish Me Not",date:"10 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-10-phish-me-not/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Nick of Time",date:"09 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-09-nick-of-time/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>As I arrived at Hauptbahnhof this afternoon, ready to take the S-Bahn to my park-and-ride lot, suddenly all southbahn S-Bahn traffic was halted. "Fire on the tracks at Wilhelmsburg. No S-Bahn until further notice. Passengers should take DB trains to Harburg." Except my car was between Harburg and Hauptbahnhof, so getting to Harburg would not have helped. After 30 minutes, I was ready to grab a cab... then the S-Bahn started rolling again. I made it home just 5 minutes before Christopher\'s bus. But I see I need to work out a Plan B for reaching the park-and-ride lot, since the S-Bahn is known to be occasionally buggy.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Getting It Wrong",date:"09 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-09-getting-it-wrong/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Ooops I Did It Again",date:"10 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-10-ooops-i-did-it-again/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:436,pageCount:1101}}}});
