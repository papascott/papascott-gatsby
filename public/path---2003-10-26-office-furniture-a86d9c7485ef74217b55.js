So, on <a title="Design Sitzgruppe Leder schwarz + Glastisch !" href="http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2355639505">ebay</a> it goes, couch, 4 chairs, and a glass table, all to the highest bidder. Wouldn\'t they look great in <em>your</em> office? The leather couch also makes a wonderful changing table, as we know from experience. And since the set must be picked up at her office in Hamburg, you\'ll have the chance to meet Mrs. PapaScott up close and personal. Bidding ends in 8 days, put in your bid today!</p>',fields:{title:"Office Furniture",date:"26 Oct 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-10-26-office-furniture/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-10-26-office-furniture/",prev:{fields:{title:"Michael Moore is bigger in Germany than he is in the US",date:"26 Oct 2003",slug:"/2003-10-26-michael-moore-is-bigger-in-germany-than-he-is-in-the-us/"}},next:{fields:{title:"3.
