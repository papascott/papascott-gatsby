It was a choice that 3 months ago we hadn't even considered.</p>\n<p>Our state of Lower Saxony still splits into the 3 traditional secondary systems, for simplicity the upper, middle, and lower tracks. We've been told since 3rd grade that our son could expect a recommendation for the upper <em>Gymnasium</em> track, and with the mid-term grades in February, that's what he got. </p>\n<p>We had resigned ourselves to choosing between two local public <em>Gymnasiums</em>. We attended open houses at both, and most of our fears were confirmed. The events were loud and chaotic. The teachers sometimes didn't know their students' names. The class sizes are well over 30. The school day ends at 1 pm, with a full load of homework for the afternoon.</p>\n<p>However, we noticed a brochure for a private <em>Gymnasium</em> near Lüneburg. It had been recommended to us before, but we had forgotten about it. We went for a visit and were impressed. Day-long school with time to do homework at school. Individual attention from teachers. A motto of \"knowledge wants to be learned\". Total school size 350 students. Class size maximum 24. No trace of elitism.</p>\n<p>There are just two disadvantages. One is the cost, but we can deal with that. The other is the distance, over 45 km. However, interested parents in the next town have organized a bus service. Departure 7:30am, travel time 45 minutes, return at 4:30pm. </p>\n<p>We made our decision, and received the papers to sign today. A small step for the next 8 years.</p>\n<p>(For now I won't be naming the school here... it's time to start respecting our son's privacy. It can easily be googled from the details I've given.)</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Certified Family-Friendly Employer",date:"11 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-11-certified-family-friendly-employer/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Deceleration",date:"19 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-19-deceleration/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Certified Family-Friendly Employer",date:"11 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-11-certified-family-friendly-employer/",tags:"Y2010"},html:'<p><a href="http://fami-siegel.de/"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/FaMi-Siegel.png" alt="FaMi-Siegel.png" border="0" width="180" height="180" align="right" /></a>We\'re very happy and proud that our restaurant in Dibbersen is a charter recipient of the <a href="http://fami-siegel.de/">FaMi Seal</a>, recognition of a family-friendly employer. We\'ve already placed the seal prominently on <a href="http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/">our restaurant website</a>.</p>\n<p>The FaMi Seal is a new initiative in northeastern Lower Saxony by the DGB (German Federation of Trade Unions), the regional <em>Handelskammer</em> (Chambers of Commerce) and <em>Arbeitgeberverband</em> (employers\' federation), the local Federaton of Women and Business, and the Leuphana University Lüneburg. In other words, the regional establishment for business, labor and education. The process involved the submission of an 8 page application documenting our efforts and an 1/2-day visit from the jury to show that we practice what we preach.</p>\n<p>What do we practice? As a nearly 24/7 business, we can coordinate the work schedules of our employees with their families. Employees with children are given priority in vacation planning. We have encouraged and enabled employees with children to move into management positions. We are willing to find individual solutions for problems that may arise. As proof that the process works, we have 4 couples (including our senior manager and his wife) working for us who are all able to coordinate their work schedules with one another and their families (which makes work schedules during school vacations interesting, but it can be done). Since January we have an office manager (who I supervise) who sets her own schedule around school and family.</p>\n<p>For us, although the public recognition is nice, this is all part of being (and not just talking about being) a good employer. It also gives us a competitive advantage in the job market, which is becoming tighter all the time as the German population ages. We see the seal not just as a reward, but as a commitment to become even better in the future. Our business will depend on it!</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Anything But Sports",date:"10 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-10-anything-but-sports/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Old School",date:"15 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-15-old-school/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Anything But Sports",date:"10 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-10-anything-but-sports/",tags:"Y2010"},html:'<p>At first it wasn\'t easy following baseball from Europe. I followed the 1991 World Series (the one where the Twins beat the Braves and <a href="http://thesportsdaddy.com/?p=798">Kirby Puckett drove the bus</a>) by reading box scores on CompuServe and catching glances a day later at the international edition USA Today on the newsstand at the Wandsbek Markt U-Bahn station. That worked until we flew to Mallorca. I caught the scores of Games 6 and 7 on Voice of America via shortwave.</p>\n<p>These days it\'s a lot easier thanks to satellite technology, hard disk recorders and the internets. I can satisfy my baseball cravings as a casual Twins fan by following news feeds from the <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/headlines.jsp?c_id=min">official Twins site</a>, the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/">StarTribune baseball writers</a>, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/min">the Twins page at Yahoo! Sports</a>, and blogger <a href="http://aarongleeman.com/">Aaron Gleeman</a>. Aaron and I share the indignity of have been snubbed by the U of M student newspaper <a href="http://www.mndaily.com/">Minnesota Daily</a>. Aaron now makes a living from a number of gigs including <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/">NBC Sports</a> and <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/content/features/column.aspx?sport=MLB&amp;columnid=13">Rotoworld</a>.</p>\n<p>On the TV side there\'s <a href="http://espnamerica.com">ESPN America</a> on German cable and satellite. For example, this week they are showing 12 baseball games live, including the Twins twice. Of course live in the US usually means wee hours of the morning here, so if you have a day job you need to record or wait for a rerun (with breaks cut out, so often better than live). The streams at <a href="http://mlb.tv">mlb.tv</a> are better yet. For a price they offer all Major League games either live or on demand, even on an iPhone if you so desire.</p>\n<p>Strangely enough, my favorite site for general sports news is the German <a href="http://www.allesaussersport.de/">allesaussersport</a> by Hamburg blogger Kai Pahl. He\'s a fan of anything and everything, but particularly NFL football. He also knows more about soccer than I ever will, so I get tips on figuring out the Bundesliga (try to say "Bruno Labbadia" and "master tactician" in the same sentence while keeping a straight face). I haven\'t been able to get into the community at <a href="http://www.allesaussersport.de/">aas</a>, though. The German commenters tend to be hard core fans of whatever sport, and as casual fan of the teams from my youth I guess I don\'t take sports seriously enough to fit in.
