I'm sure readers of Daring Fireball often thing he's wrong, especially when he talks about politics or the Yankees, but in this case he's wrong about fatherhood when he writes that when your son is eight years old <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2011/12/merry\">that's as good as it gets</a>.</p>\n<p>That's wrong. It keeps getting better and better.</p>\n<p>Our son is starting to become an adult and think for himself. Of course as parents we're the ones he challenges the most with his new ideas, and they're not always right, but they're his ideas. He has my sense of humor and laughs at my jokes. He is an environmentalist and has a deep sense of right and wrong, and he is persistent in convincing others that his right and wrong is right for everyone. He's so smart it's scary. Just the past 3 weeks he's aced 4 tests in various subjects at school, even in subjects that weren't his strongest. He's sometimes a bit of a pessimist. I'm hoping to convince him that it's easier to change the world when you think you can do it. But even now, I'm impressed and amazed by him and I can't wait for tomorrow to see what he will do and become next.</p>\n<p>And he turns twelve today. Happy Birthday, Christopher!</p>",fields:{title:"Twelve",date:"27 Dec 2011",url:"https://papascott.de/2011-12-27-twelve/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2011-12-27-twelve/",prev:{fields:{title:"Four Days of Christmas",date:"23 Dec 2011",slug:"/2011-12-23-four-days-of-christmas/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Alarm Clocks",date:"11 Jan 2012",slug:"/2012-01-11-alarm-clocks/"}}}}}});
