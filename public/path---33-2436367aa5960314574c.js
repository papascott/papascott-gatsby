It will be located on the Autobahn A1 at Rade, the first exit from Hamburg heading towards Bremen. We expect to open at the end of June.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/map.jpg" alt="Map" border="0" width="466" height="405" /></p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/limfresh.jpg" alt="Limfresh" border="0" width="331" height="212" align="right" />The restaurant with McCaf√© will be part of an Autohof, a truck stop and gas station, and our logo will appear on official Autobahn signage leading to the Autohof. Over 70,000 cars per day pass Rade on the Autobahn. It also fills a hole in the McDonald\'s map. From the west, the nearest restaurant is at Bockel, 44 km away. To the east, our restaurant at Dibbersen is less than 8 km away, but with the Autobahn crossing "Buchholzer Dreieck" between the two stores, they have completely different traffic patterns. Traffic from the Elbtunnel heading south drive past Rade, but not Dibbersen. </p>\n<p>We\'ll be part of the LogPark Hamburg, a logistics center currently under construction on both sides of the Autobahn. We\'ll be located alongside the eastbound lane before the exit, so we\'ll be impossible to miss. We won\'t need an overly large sign to be visible from 2 km away.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/easyoder.jpg" alt="Easyorder" border="0" width="289" height="211" align="left" />The current standard building type in Germany features a green exterior with wood trim and all the latest energy-saving innovations. We\'ve chosen a colorful "LIM Fresh" interior for an expected 130 seats inside and 70 seats outside. Among the extras we\'ve chosen are touch-screen "Easy Order" kiosks to enable guests to enter and pay for their orders before coming to the counter.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/stromtanken.jpg" alt="Stromtanken" border="0" width="229" height="335" align="right" />A special innovation will the charging station for electric vehicles, only the 5th of its kind at German McDonald\'s. You\'ll be able to charge your battery with eco-power while enjoying your meal. We\'ll be adding an electric car to our company fleet. With a top speed of 100 kmh and a range of 130 km, it should be perfect for driving between our 4 restaurants.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/esmart.jpg" alt="Esmart" border="0" width="224" height="146" align="left" />We\'ve been discussing the site with McDonald\'s for over a year, and we\'re very happy that we\'ll be open for the entire school vacation season this summer. The Autohof won\'t be completed until this fall, so things will be a bit dusty for the first few months. Right now we have the first big challenge: finding 70 new employees in a booming economy to be set to open in 10 weeks. Wish us luck!</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Road Construction",date:"21 Apr 2011",slug:"/2011-04-21-road-construction/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"The Plan Doesn't Come Together",date:"04 May 2011",slug:"/2011-05-04-the-plan-doesnt-come-together/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Road Construction",date:"21 Apr 2011",slug:"/2011-04-21-road-construction/",tags:"Y2011"},html:'<p>Normally our village is pretty quiet. We only have 4 streets, none of which are paved, a couple dozen houses, and no shops at all (no bakery, no post office, no grocer, no gas station) other than a bio farmer who sells asparagus in the spring and Christmas trees in December.

They\'re building a rain drainage pond to the right and big drainage pipes under the road.</p>\n<p>The intersection of the county roads is being turned into a traffic circle. One lane is available through the crossing regulation, only one direction can drive through at a time, regulated by traffic lights (dots).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile a bicycle path is being built on the county road starting in our village and heading off several km to the north. For us that means the sidewalk is being widened and the street narrowed.</p>\n<p>The end effect is that the traffic that normally turns south at the crossing redirects itself onto our cobblestone streets. It\'s not a marked detour, but people take it anyway, ignoring the no-trucks sign and the 30 kmh speed limit. (The road marked Sand is just a tractor path and leads nowhere unless you\'re an asparagus picker.) We can hear traffic past our house starting at 6am, just after the early-morning birds stop chirping.</p>\n<p>The construction should be done in early June, and until then we won\'t be needing our alarm clocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The same day this was posted, the circle was opened to traffic in all directions. No more unofficial detours on our street!

Annoyingly, the direct flight from Amsterdam costs more than it would have to fly one-stop (in Amsterdam) from Hamburg.</p>\n<p>We're all three feeling mostly excited but a just little bit scared. It's good that we we planned this trip for him alone, since the way our business looks we won't be able to get away for a family trip this year.</p>\n<p>Our son will return home on Easter Saturday, so he can be at our local Easter fire with his Youth Fire Dept. comrades.
