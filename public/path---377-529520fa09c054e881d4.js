(The LiveJournal link is his personal blog, professionally he has several Russian news sites including <a href="http://www.mosnews.com/" title="MOSNEWS.COM">mosnews.com</a> in English.) It was interesting to hear his main first impression of Germany: the "friendly" roads and drivers. The autobahns are certainly well built, and built for speed, but are German drivers really friendly? But then I remembered the t.A.T.u. album title "200 km/h in the Wrong Lane"... if that\'s a description of Russian driving, then German drivers must seem very friendly indeed. </p>\n<p>When I told him I came from Minnesota, he immediately thought of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/">Fargo</a>, and asked if Minnesotans really use wood chippers that way (if you\'ve never seen the movie, don\'t ask...). He also got the impression that Minnesota is colder than Moscow. Somehow I doubt that.</p>\n<p>Finally, he refuted one of my misconceptions about journalists. I had just maintained on the train ride to Cologne to Heiko and Gerd that the difference between journalists and bloggers is that blogger are can choose *not* to write, that they do not have a quota of minutes or column inches to fill. But Anton told me of a certain business dispute in Russia where both sides were paying him *not* to report the details, a form of reverse PR. He had no problems with that, since he wasn\'t intending to report on it anyway, but he was still disappointed when the dispute was settled.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Pirates of the Internet",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-pirates-of-the-internet/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Leappad Comes To Germany",date:"24 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-24-leappad-comes-to-germany/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Pirates of the Internet",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-pirates-of-the-internet/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>Since we didn't actually talk that much about press freedom at the discussion, I didn't get a chance to use the line I came up with. So I'll have to give it here.</p>\n<p>If we're talking about press freedom in a place where it can really make a difference, we're talking about a place that doesn't have it yet. And a government interested in controlling the press is going to be controlling the internet was well. The internet runs over wires and cables, and a poor country is not going to have that many cables coming in. And big IT companies like Sun, Cisco and IBM are going to be more than happy to sell the the equipment and know-how to control everything going in and out.</p>\n<p>That's no problem if you're going to be sending secret messages, you just use encryption and let the spooks spin their wheels. But weblogs are public messages, and once a weblog becomes bothersome, it's easy enough for a government to shut them down, or block them if they are hosted abroad.</p>\n<p>There are, however, a group of internet entrepreneurs that creatively and successfully work around such filters. If webloggers want to deliver a message to a place where the powers that be do not want that message to be heard, they have to start thinking like those entrepreneurs. </p>\n<p>That's right, webloggers have to start thinking like spammers, pornographers and file traders. That's the way to route around censorship.</p>\n<p>(Insert code for distributing web content through national firewalls via a Firefox bittorrent plugin here.)</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Early Morning Cologne",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-early-morning-cologne/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Wild Wild East",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-wild-wild-east/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Early Morning Cologne",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-early-morning-cologne/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>I came to Cologne grateful for the invitation from the Deutsche Welle, but skeptical about the event. A discussion forum about blogging, organized for and by the mainstream media, <em>Das kann nicht gut gehen</em>, that could never work. However, it turned out that DW let the bloggers run the show, and so it was an excellent blogger meeting with some foreign guests. And an open bar. Sure, there were some DW types standing around with "look at those crazy kids" expressions, but they let us have our fun. There were maybe one or two journalists in attendance, so it was by and large a blogger event.</p>\n<p>What DW offers and what makes the BOBS awards more valuable that I had expected are its language resources. Bloggers talk a lot about creating international cross contacts, but we\'re not really sure how to overcome the language barrier. Delivering messages in several languages is something DW does every day. By bringing together a jury to evaluate weblogs in 7 languages, they let us overcome that language barrier, at least for a moment. They are able to bring Mu Zimei to us, even though she has never before left China and speaks only Chinese. </p>\n<p>The jury\'s decision will only be annonced in two weeks, but I\'m sure they have picked as Best Blog of the Moment some weblog from a far corner of the world that "we" have never heard of, in a language "we" cannot understand, and that tells a story that is for "us" completely new and exciting. And that\'s why I do this weblog thing, to keep hearing new stories.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Amok under hunting stand",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-amok-under-hunting-stand/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Pirates of the Internet",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-pirates-of-the-internet/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:377,pageCount:1101}}}});
