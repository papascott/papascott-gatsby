Most of the red spots are from two moves cross-crountry (CA-MN and MN-AZ) and two bus trips (NYC and DC).</p>\n<p>But seeing peoples\' maps reminds me of my great-aunt Violet, who managed to visit all state capitols back when there were only 48. She lived on a ranch in Nebraska back when there were still real cowboys. She turns 98 this year, and she\'s been in the hospital the past two weeks with pneumoni a. At 98, small problems can complicate quickly, and in her case she is unable to swallow and therefore cannot eat or drink. She\'s awake and alert, and has opted for a feeding tube. We\'re hoping she can hang in there.</p>',fields:{title:"State of Mind",date:"01 Feb 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-02-01-state-of-mind/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-02-01-state-of-mind/",prev:{fields:{title:"Boing Boing: How to get spyware-free RealPlayer through the BBC",date:"01 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-01-boing-boing-how-to-get-spyware-free-realplayer-through-the-bbc/"}},next:{fields:{title:"BackupPC: Performance Problems Solved?",date:"02 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-02-backuppc-performance-problems-solved/"}}}}}});
