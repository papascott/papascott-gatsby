At work we\'ve set the Christmas party for the end of January and are calling it a "End of Year" party. People seem to have more time in for Christmas parties in January anyway.</p>\n<p>At least I got our photo cards ready for our friends and relatives in the States (as always at the <a href="http://www.usps.com/cardstore/">USPS Card Store</a>, where they mail the cards for us at domestic rates). Nothing new in the card if you read PapaScott regularly, but I did come up with a couple of good lines...</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  After 24 years of Frauke working for McDonald\'s, McDonald\'s now works for us!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(Almost sounds like a Soviet Russia joke. :-) )</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  (Christopher) keeps reminding us what is really important, and makes our lives a joy (even if it is sometimes a little messy).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I now notice I have at least one typo in the final version of the printed card. That\'s the nice thing about the internet... you can always go back and correct your speling.</p>',fields:{title:"December Surprise",date:"17 Dec 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-12-17-december-surprise/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-12-17-december-surprise/",prev:{fields:{title:"Monomedia",date:"16 Dec 2007",slug:"/2007-12-16-monomedia/"}},next:{fields:{title:"POTS VPN",date:"17 Dec 2007",slug:"/2007-12-17-pots-vpn/"}}}}}});
