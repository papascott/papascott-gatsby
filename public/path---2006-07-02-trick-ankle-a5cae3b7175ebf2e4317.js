About 500m into the run she stepped on a plastic bottle that someone had dropped, her ankle gave way, and fell in agony to the ground. The medics took her away in an ambulance, and her race was over. She has torn ligaments in the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/18/injured-reserve/">same ankle</a> as in 2003, and will be limping for 4 weeks. Good thing we didn\'t toss out the crutches.</p>\n<p>And she\'ll miss the World Cup final in Berlin next weekend.</p>',fields:{title:"Trick Ankle",date:"02 Jul 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-07-02-trick-ankle/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-07-02-trick-ankle/",prev:{fields:{title:"Italia",date:"02 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-02-italia/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Christopher Wins",date:"04 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-04-christopher-wins/"}}}}}});
