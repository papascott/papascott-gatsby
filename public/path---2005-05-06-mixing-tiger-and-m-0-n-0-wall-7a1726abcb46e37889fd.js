Quick review: everything seems faster, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> is weird, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> is lame.</p>\n<p>But I\'ve run into an obscure and annoying bug. At work we run <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/">m0n0wall</a>, a tiny firewall based on FreeBSD (and which I can heartily recommend). The only access is via a web front-end (mini\\_httpd with php).  I found that accessing the m0n0wall with Firefox under Tiger causes the <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.firewalls.m0n0wall/16455" title="gmane.comp.security.firewalls.m0n0wall">mini\\_httpd in m0n0wall to crash</a>. The firewall is still running, you just can\'t view or change settings. It took me 3 or 4 crashes to associate them with Tiger, but then I was able to reproduce the behavior, and it was confirmed by another member of the mailing list.</p>\n<p>mini\\_httpd might be sensitive; there was a <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.firewalls.m0n0wall/7298">previous bug reported</a> involving crashes on m0n0wall. And Tiger seems to have some <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/networks/0,39020345,39197135,00.htm" title="Networking firms lash out at Tiger - ZDNet UK News">networking issues</a>. But for now you\'ll want to avoid accessing m0n0wall with Firefox under Tiger, and if you administer a remote m0n0wall you might want to consider <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~fredmol/m0n0/">the modified m0n0wall image with ssh</a> so you can restart mini_httpd without physically rebooting.</p>',fields:{title:"Mixing Tiger and m0n0wall",date:"06 May 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-05-06-mixing-tiger-and-m0n0wall/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-05-06-mixing-tiger-and-m0n0wall/",prev:{fields:{title:"Locked In",date:"06 May 2005",slug:"/2005-05-06-locked-in/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Paris Hilton On Blogs",date:"06 May 2005",slug:"/2005-05-06-paris-hilton-on-blogs/"}}}}}});
