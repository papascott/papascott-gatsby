Not bad for a 150 general purpose camera, but all you can do is point at a spot, hope for the action to get there, and get an accidental shot. The picture of Frank Rost cleaning the toilet paper out of his goal before kickoff is good, though.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5604870569" title="View \'IMG_0011\' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0011" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5190/5604870569_526e41babc.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5604871173" title="View \'IMG_0014\' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0014" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5604871173_54bb37e3ed.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5604872537" title="View \'IMG_0022\' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0022" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5066/5604872537_dfb8d5851e.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Green Card",date:"30 Mar 2011",slug:"/2011-03-30-green-card/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Quiet Week",date:"14 Apr 2011",slug:"/2011-04-14-quiet-week/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Green Card",date:"30 Mar 2011",slug:"/2011-03-30-green-card/",tags:"Y2011"},html:'<p>![Greencard](<a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/">http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/</a>\n03/greencard.jpg){: class="alignright"}My wife had incredibly bad luck with her <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/greencard">green\ncard</a>.</p>\n<p>You may\n[recall](<a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-">http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-</a>\nexcited/) that she arrived in the US with a fiancée visa which, once the\nfiancée bit is consummated, so to speak, entitles one to permanent\nresidence and a green card.
