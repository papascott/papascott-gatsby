That\'s a lot simpler than I thought it would be. While he imagines the solution for OS X, I\'m sure you could get it to work with <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> under Windows as well.

This is a long, somewhat personal post where I\'m trying to make sense of things. It seems to fit in better at the other site. </p>\n<p>I received the following mail from Switzerland:<br />\n<i>Hi Scott<br />\nWe are looking for Katja. Could you please tell her to make a phone call to me ore to our mother (We don\'t have a new adress). Thanks.<br />\nI wish you all the best for the new year.<br />\nClaudia</i><br />\nExcept that we don\'t know a Katja, or a Claudia in Switzerland. At least we don\'t think we do. She might be a spammer trying to confirm my address. If you\'re reading this, Claudia, and we do truly know you, and you are not a spammer, could you please remind us of who you are?
