I have one (un, eins, uno) point, and it took a herioc effort by Zidane to achieve that. Yesterday, for example, I picked Italy to win and Sweden to tie. Today I\'ve picked the Czechs and Holland to win, so things are looking good for a couple of upsets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=323">Nico</a> is complaining about the announcing talents of Reinhold Beckmann. They must not get ZDF in Lummaland, because there\'s <em>nobody</em> worse (not even Fa√üblinder) than Johannes B. (as in Brainless) Kerner. Meanwhile <a href="http://www.neilarmstrong.de/weblog/2004_06_01_archive.html#108721607705602524">Neil</a> is going on about the wonderful German announcers, which I guess means the British have it even worse than anyone had imagined. (I personally use a face-recognition system on my TV that activates the mute button whenever Beckenbauer\'s face appears on the screen.)</p>',fields:{title:"Tip Me Not",date:"15 Jun 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-06-15-tip-me-not/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-06-15-tip-me-not/",prev:{fields:{title:"Pardon Me?",date:"15 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-15-pardon-me/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Egil Aarvik",date:"16 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-16-egil-aarvik/"}}}}}});
