Whatever I tried at work backfired, I was going backwards instead of making progress. Mama's out of town, and Christopher was wary and antsy. After I left him in bed bed he got up again and fell on his head. He said his ear hurt badly, and he is not prone to simulate such things. I could see no external signs of injury, but I still had visions of a concussion or worse. A cold pack seemed to help, but it then took another 2 hours to get him to sleep. </p>\n<p>I've started adding RSS links to the <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/sidebar.php\">papascott blogroll</a>, by hand for now, being uninspired. I will be doing something more intelligent with them,  I promise.</p>",fields:{title:"Uninspiring",date:"18 Sep 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-09-18-uninspiring/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-09-18-uninspiring/",prev:{fields:{title:"Trading Allies for Votes",date:"16 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-16-trading-allies-for-votes/"}},next:{fields:{title:"You May Be Right",date:"18 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-18-you-may-be-right/"}}}}}});
