It's do-it-all-in-one-place and do-it-anywhere instant messaging. Most <a href=\\\"http://vowe.net/archives/006817.html\\\">reviews</a> have concentrated on the web-client, but that's not where the magic is going to be. (Quite frankly, I find the web-client very distracting, and when working I use a <a href=\\\"http://www.adiumx.com/\\\">traditional client</a> to connect to mabber. That works, too.)

So I don't know if anything I'm saying about it is true. The key is going to be how easy it is. If it's a pain to install and contacts have to be added manually, it's not going to work. If it is truly easier to use than SMS, we'll have a killer app. </p>\\n<p>In the tradition of Google mabber is an invitation-only beta, but we're pretty <a href=\\\"mailto:info@mabber.com\\\">loose</a> with invitations.
