Our McDrive is open until 4 am on weekends, and we made the decision not to stay open an extra hour for the time change.</p>\n<p>I had night shift that night, and I closed at 4 am DST as planned. Twenty minutes later a very angry guest pounded on our drive-thru window. It was 3:20, we should be open, and why wouldn\'t we serve him?</p>\n<p>As is often the case with arrogant Germans, technically he was correct. Standard Time was in effect, the time was 3:20 am. However, it\'s my business and I can open and close the doors when I damn well please. I shouted politely but firmly through the closed window that we were closed, and that if he did not leave the premises in 5 minutes I would call the cops.</p>\n<p>The angry guest then left. Being a know-it-all German means that you can often be smug about being correct, but it usually doesn\'t make things any better. He was still hungry.</p>',fields:{title:"What Time Is It?",date:"08 Nov 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-11-08-what-time-is-it/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-11-08-what-time-is-it/",prev:{fields:{title:"What If You Get Stopped?",date:"07 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-07-what-if-you-get-stopped/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Best.
