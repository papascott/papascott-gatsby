That\'s a lot simpler than I thought it would be. While he imagines the solution for OS X, I\'m sure you could get it to work with <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> under Windows as well. But I don\'t have the time to pursue it.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.papascott.de">papascott.de</a>: <a href="/2002/01/17/index.php#000091">9/11: A Brick In A Bedsheet</a>. "Visiting the States last month, it was quickly apparent that the effect of 9/11 on ordinary people was much deeper than I had imagined..." This is a long, somewhat personal post where I\'m trying to make sense of things. It seems to fit in better at the other site. </p>\n<p>I received the following mail from Switzerland:<br />\n<i>Hi Scott<br />\nWe are looking for Katja. Could you please tell her to make a phone call to me ore to our mother (We don\'t have a new adress). Thanks.<br />\nI wish you all the best for the new year.<br />\nClaudia</i><br />\nExcept that we don\'t know a Katja, or a Claudia in Switzerland. At least we don\'t think we do. She might be a spammer trying to confirm my address. If you\'re reading this, Claudia, and we do truly know you, and you are not a spammer, could you please remind us of who you are? Thanks.</p>',fields:{title:"Throwing a Brick",date:"17 Jan 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-01-17-throwing-a-brick/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-01-17-throwing-a-brick/",prev:{fields:{title:"Red-Red in the Red Rathaus",date:"17 Jan 2002",slug:"/2002-01-17-red-red-in-the-red-rathaus/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Garbage In, ASCII Out",date:"18 Jan 2002",slug:"/2002-01-18-garbage-in-ascii-out/"}}}}}});
