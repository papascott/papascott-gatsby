As it happened -- as she felt her brain functions slip away one by one, speech, movement, understanding -- she studied and remembered every moment. This is a powerful story about how our brains define us and connect us to the world and to one another.\n</p></blockquote>'},next:{fields:{title:"One-Armed Bandit",date:"11 Mar 2008",slug:"/2008-03-11-one-armed-bandit/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Twins Ad with Pat Neshek",date:"18 Mar 2008",slug:"/2008-03-18-twins-ad-with-pat-neshek/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"One-Armed Bandit",date:"11 Mar 2008",slug:"/2008-03-11-one-armed-bandit/",tags:"Y2008"},html:"<p>Frauke had surgery on her right hand last week for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_Tunnel_Syndrome\">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</a>. Her arm had been bothering her for a couple of months, with numbness and pins-and-needles feeling at night. After some unsuccessful local treatments, our orthopedist sent her to a neurologist who confirmed that the median nerve was indeed being pinched and that surgery would be the best option.</p>\n<p>Our orthopedist also performed the surgery, and she's been back 3 times already for follow-up. Her right hand is still in a splint, but she was back at work the afternoon on the surgery. She says she can make a lot on add-on sales in McCaf&eacute; based on sympathy. She can't drive her Touran because of the manual transmission, but has traded cars with an employee so she remains mobile.</p>\n<p>Her hand is doing fine and is recovering on schedule.
