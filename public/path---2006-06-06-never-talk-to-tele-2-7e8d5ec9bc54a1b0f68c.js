I politely said I wasn\'t interested and hung up. I never buy anything on the phone.</p>\n<p>The telemarketer from Tele2 apparently disagreed, and submitted an order in my name anyway. A letter arrived a week later thanking me for my registration. I immediately faxed a cancelation to Tele2 Customer Service.</p>\n<p>The cancelation was ignored. This weekend T-Com informed me that all calls from our line would be routed through Tele2. I called T-Com this morning, and they seemed to be familiar with the scam. When I mentioned I was calling about a pre-select change, the rep replied "You don\'t want it, right?". He assured me that the routing change would be ignored.</p>\n<p>I\'m not sure what advice I should give. I would never do business with Tele2, but even if you don\'t talk them, you might end up doing business with them anyway.</p>',fields:{title:"Never Talk to Tele2",date:"06 Jun 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-06-06-never-talk-to-tele2/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-06-06-never-talk-to-tele2/",prev:{fields:{title:"Stormy Weather",date:"05 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-05-stormy-weather/"}},next:{fields:{title:"From the World Cup Front",date:"08 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-08-from-the-world-cup-front/"}}}}}});
