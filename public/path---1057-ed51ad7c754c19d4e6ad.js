An unsatisfying but fair result. After a total disaster in the first 20 minutes, the Germans were able to equilize and then controlled (without scoring) the final 30 minutes.

Here in Lüllau, there is a tradition of \'Pentecost Singers\'. On Saturday evening, the young men bring birch trees to each house, and on Sunday morning the boys and girls (in separate groups) sing from house to house. All three groups then expect a gift of schnaps (for the men) or candy (for the kids). </p>\n<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/">Andrea</a> says "In Hetzwege, the village in which I grew up, the young men also bring Pfingstbäume (Pentecost trees) to each house, getting schnaps in return.

The Turks were robbed.

Christopher and I watched parts of the replay of France-Denmark this afternoon. The score is an overstatement, but France looked strong nonetheless. </p>\n<p>Group A, which includes Germany and England, opens play this evening.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Cobblestones",date:"08 Jun 2000",slug:"/2000-06-08-cobblestones/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"More Euro",date:"13 Jun 2000",slug:"/2000-06-13-more-euro/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:1057,pageCount:1101}}}});
