This winter Schröder tried to revive the Alliance, but after a preliminary meeting Monday he <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_792300_1_A,00.html">declared the Alliance for Jobs for dead</a>, and that he would present his own proposals for economic reform in an address on March 14.</p>\n<p>This may be a significant move by Schröder to move away from the unions and show real leadership, a sign that he is willing to work together with opposition to pull Germany out of its economic crisis. Or it may be just a lot of hot air. But in case the change is for real, it has now begun.</p>',fields:{title:"The End of Consensus",date:"05 Mar 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-03-05-the-end-of-consensus/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-03-05-the-end-of-consensus/",prev:{fields:{title:"One, Two, Three",date:"05 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-05-one-two-three/"}},next:{fields:{title:"I Fought the Ants but the Ants Won",date:"06 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-06-i-fought-the-ants-but-the-ants-won/"}}}}}});
