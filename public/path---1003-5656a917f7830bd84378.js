His sister-in-law\'s brother had a heart attack about a month ago so was unable to plant his crops.  He has about a 1000 acres.  Dad, two of his brothers along with a couple of neighbors and a son got going on Wed. and Thurs. and it sounded like they would finish up Friday. I think they meant all of it.  Then after a few weeks, the neighbor will spray for weeds and then they are set till harvest."</p>\n<p><b>And finally in soccer</b></p>\n<p>Hamburg\'s inner-city team <a href="http://www.fcstpauli.de">FC St. Pauli</a> has promoted to the Bundesliga 1st league for the 4th in 12 years (which means they\'ve been demoted to the 2nd league 3 times in that same time period).  I imagine that in a year or two they\'ll be back in the 2nd league, but it will be fun to have them in the big league for a while, if nothing else than to watch overpaid teams like Bayern Munich play in their dinky neighborhood stadium.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"The Mug Game",date:"19 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-19-the-mug-game/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Change of Channels",date:"21 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-21-change-of-channels/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"The Mug Game",date:"19 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-19-the-mug-game/",tags:"Y2001"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/muggame.jpg" height="224" width="300" border="0" alt="muggame.jpg: " /></p>\n<p>Christopher has invented a new game.
