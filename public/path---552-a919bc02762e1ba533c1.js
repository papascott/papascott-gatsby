The Maricopa County Recorder was kind enough to send it by Express Mail to make sure my vote can be counted.</p>\n<p>I remember my first caucus, back in 1980 in Minnesota. I was a high school senior, and belonged to the dark side (Independent Republicans, as they were known in MN back then). I forget who I supported for President (not Reagan... Bush? Dole?). But I did get elected to the county, and then the congressional district convention. One of the candidates looked me up at my after-school job, cleaning the meat market at the local grocers. He shook my hand, even though I was covered with blood and beef fat. Even though he wasn\'t local and was too conservative for my taste, he got my vote, he won the nomination, and was elected. <a href="http://www.mediatransparency.org/people/vin_weber.htm">Vin Weber</a> was one of the conservative stars in the House in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>That August, one day before nominating Ronald Reagan, the National Republican Convention voted to drop support for the Equal Rights Amendment, and I vowed to never support the Republicans again. That fall I voted for John Anderson.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Anil Dash: Microsoft *nix",date:"19 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-19-anil-dash-microsoft-nix/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"American Voices Abroad - Berlin",date:"20 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-20-american-voices-abroad-berlin/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Anil Dash: Microsoft *nix",date:"19 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-19-anil-dash-microsoft-nix/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="90% of Darwin, now free for Windows" href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/01/19/microsoft_nix">Anil Dash: Microsoft *nix</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"",date:"17 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-17-luellauer-gegen-wind/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"I Have A Voice",date:"19 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-19-i-have-a-voice/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:552,pageCount:1101}}}});
