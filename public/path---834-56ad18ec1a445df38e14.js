Mama's company car was caught speeding there, clearly visible on photo radar. The driver is not clearly visible, except that it is a male wearing a tie, and the authorities are asking her to identify the driver. According to her driver's logbook, she was on the road that day with the vice-chair (who insisted on driving) and a member of her company's German board of directors. So does she implicate her boss' boss, or does she stay silent and take the fine and the points (&euro;50 and 3 points, according the the <a href=\"http://www.adac.de/Recht_und_Rat/Verkehrssuenden/Verkehrsverstoesse_und_ihre_Auswirkungen/Das_kosten_Verkehrsverstoesse\">ADAC</a> auto club) for herself?</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Weblogs and your job",date:"10 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-10-weblogs-and-your-job/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Extra Dry",date:"11 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-11-extra-dry/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Weblogs and your job",date:"10 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-10-weblogs-and-your-job/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>After <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2001/10/01.html#write">several</a> <a href="http://www.dooce.com/02_26_02.html">cases</a> in the States of webloggers losing their jobs because of their weblogs (I\'m just linking two out of lack of time), we now have a case in Germany. She hasn\'t lost her job yet, but Simone of <a href="http://www.bluepixel.chimerahost.de/">bluepixel</a> (site now blank) has been given a <em>Abmanhung</em> (cease and desist order, legal step before being fired) by her employer for allegedly revealing company secrets on her blog.

All I can add is that a weblog is not a private place. It\'s public. You have to write as if your employer is reading every word, as well as your wife, your lover, your parents, your children, your enemies, and the whole world. Then again, if your boss is going to be such a jerk, you\'re probably better off without that boss. </p>\n<p>Simone wrote often about how she\'d rather be at the North Sea.
