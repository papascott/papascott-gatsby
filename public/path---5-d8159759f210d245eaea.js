And since stupid people generally don't recognize their own stupidity, almost every one of us is faced with a stupid majority.</p>\n<p>However, if you are stupid, and you know it, you can rest assured that there is a smart majority out there to make the decisions for you.</p>\n<p>But the average person, of average intelligence, the average person has a great responsibility.
