There was one set of images that got to me most, ones I didn\'t remember seeing before. As we all have, I\'d seen many times the crushing images of bodies falling the hundreds of feet from the upper floors of the towers. But I hadn\'t seen or didn\'t remember the close-ups, the zoom-ins of people on the upper floors leaning out the windows and waiving shirts or clothes into the air, trying to grab the attention of helicopters circling nearby, hoping for help. To me these sorts of images are worse than all the rest, the bodies falling, all of them. There is something unbearable about seeing people clinging to hope when, you know, there is no hope. Their fate is sealed; they just didn\'t know it yet. Those were the pictures that even today made me grit my teeth and twist up my face."</p>',fields:{title:"Time Stood Still",date:"11 Sep 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-09-11-time-stood-still/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-09-11-time-stood-still/",prev:{fields:{title:"Swedish Foreign Minister Dies After Attack",date:"11 Sep 2003",slug:"/2003-09-11-swedish-foreign-minister-dies-after-attack/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Hope Against Hope",date:"12 Sep 2003",slug:"/2003-09-12-hope-against-hope/"}}}}}});
