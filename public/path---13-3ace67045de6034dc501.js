I wasn't there yet, I had only made it as far as London. He was always impatient, he never liked waiting for anyone when he was ready to go.</p>\n<p>It's not like we weren't ready for this. He's been on oxygen for 11 years, at first only at night, and later 24 hours. I always wondered how I would feel when the time came. Now I know. I feel his absence. Absence, as in the opposite of presence.</p>\n<p>Now I'm home with my mother and brother to together go through the rituals. We spoke with the funeral home yesterday, made the decisions, gave details for the obituary, looked at the plot, picked out flowers. Viewing is Sunday afternoon, prayer service that evening, funeral 10:30 Monday morning. We tried to do things to make it informal and not all too a somber and sad affair.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.zahrbockfuneralhome.com/obituaries.php\">obituary will be online</a>. That's a thing now I guess. If you have Flash music will play, you may want to turn it down first.</p>\n<p>Our son arrives from Germany today. He brought his bagpipes.

When we built our house back in 1996, when we got to designing the bathroom we had run out of both money and imagination. We ended with boring hospital-white. We* tore everything out, replaced and rearranged the fixtures, threw out the tub, built a new wall, replaced the door and window, and installed a walk-in spa-like shower. After two and half weeks without a bath, it's done enough that we can use it. We're missing a few details yet, like towel hooks, toilet paper dispenser, mirrors, and cabinets.</p>\n<p>*Of course, \"we did\" actually means \"we hired professionals to do\", but we did build the Ikea Godmorgen sink cabinet ourselves. </p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've now added panorama photos und put them all in a Flickr album.</p>\n{::nomarkdown}<div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 76%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe id='iframe' src='http://flickrit.com/slideshowholder.php?height=75&size=big&setId=72157644926436595&thumbnails=0&transition=0&layoutType=responsive&sort=0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0'style='width:100%; height:100%; position: absolute; top:0; left:0;' > </iframe></div>{:/nomarkdown}"},next:{fields:{title:"Phone Tricks 2014",date:"31 Mar 2014",slug:"/2014-03-31-phone-tricks-2014/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Absence",date:"04 Oct 2014",slug:"/2014-10-04-absence/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Phone Tricks 2014",date:"31 Mar 2014",slug:"/2014-03-31-phone-tricks-2014/",tags:"Y2014"},html:'<p>To keep in touch with home I find it handy to have an US phone number. We never got in the habit of using Skype; a cordless phone is just a lot handier than turning on the PC. For a while I had a US Skype Number with a Minnesota area code. However, at â‚¬5 a month it\'s not that cheap, and worse, my parents were not able to reach the number from their cell phones. And if I forward the calls to our regular German number, I pay Skype rates for the privilege.</p>\n<p>So I did some hunting around, and discovered the VOIP provider <a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/default.asp">Anveo</a> offers US numbers pay-as-you-go for $2 a month (<a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/mainphonenumbers.asp">"Personal Unlimited"</a> plan). You can then forward the calls to a regular number at their normal rates, but since we have VOIP at home anyway, I just set them up as an additional account and pay nothing. Calls to the US cost $0.01 per minute, slightly cheaper than our main provider. They have servers in both the US and Germany. We\'ve been with them for 2 months, and they seem to work just fine.</p>\n<p>In case you\'re wondering, our main VOIP (for home and home office) is on <a href="http://www.sipgate.de/team/voip">Sipgate Team</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004U6NTXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B004U6NTXU&linkCode=as2&tag=papascott-21">Gigaset C610 IP</a><img src="//ir-de.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=papascott-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B004U6NTXU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> base station. I tried first with a Fritz Box, but never managed to get it working reliably, probably because the Fritz Box was not our router, but behind our router.</p>\n<p>The other trick to plan mobile phone and data for our visits to the US. Prepaid credit expires quickly in the States, so if you\'re there just once or twice a year it\'s likely cheapest to set up something new each year. This year we\'re trying service from <a href="http://goredpocket.com/">Red Pocket</a> sold by <a href="http://www.reisesim.de/">ReiseSIM.de</a> in Germany. The SIMs are pre-activated, you can add credit before your trip, and you can dial direct without going through a gateway to call Germany. Calls are $0.10/min in the US and $0.11/min to Germany. Network is ATT, and for the data plans <a href="http://goredpocket.com/plans#gsmt-mi">"tethering is encouraged"</a> (that was our mistake last year, no tethering, and we constantly fought over the one tablet with internet). Our son will be taking a phone on his Easter trip to Minnesota, and we\'re in Orlando for business at the end of April, so we\'ll see how it goes.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"B-52's",date:"09 Feb 2014",slug:"/2014-02-09-b-52s/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Godmorgen",date:"30 May 2014",slug:"/2014-05-30-godmorgen/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:13,pageCount:1101}}}});
