Schroeder won in the former Communist East. The more pro-American Stoiber won among America's allies of more than 5 decades in the West....\" </p>\n<p>I wouldn't overestimate the influence of the eastern states, with just 18% of the electorate. Yes, the 5 eastern states overwhelmingly supported the SPD (39.2% to 29.0%) while the west favored the Union (40.6% to 37.9%). However, the Union won just 3 of 11 western states. Stoiber's majority in the west came from his landslide in Bavaria (42.2% to 33.1%). If Bavaria is excluded, the SPD handily won the 'rest of the west' (40.8% to 36.4%). The north-south divide is just as pronounced as east-west. </p>\n<p>From the beginning of the Federal Republic, the Union could count on a 'Bürgerliche Mehrheit', a center-right majority (the SPD governments of Brandt and Schmidt were exceptions when the FDP jumped ship). Now the center-right has lost two elections in a row. The self-destruction of the PDS can only further help the SPD. At today's SPD party congress to approve the new coalition, Chancellor Schröder declared that 'now, once and for all, this is no longer a CDU country'. Unless the Union can find a new long-term strategy, it will stay that way.</p>\n<p>(My figures are back-of-an-envelope calculations from the state by state 2nd vote results available from the <a href=\"http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/\">Bundeswahlleiter</a>, link seen at <a href=\"http://toaster.michael-timm.de/\">Toaster XP</a>.)</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Ping On You",date:"18 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-18-ping-on-you/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"",date:"20 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-20-moellemann-resigns/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Ping On You",date:"18 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-18-ping-on-you/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>I'm not a TCP/IP expert, but I got to feel like one today. Our Notes admin Stefan was wondering why the virus checker in Leipzig wasn't able to download updates from the web over the Squid proxy, even though it was set up exactly like the one in Hamburg.  The proxy even has the same internal IP, but it couldn't be found. And the proxy logs didn't even show an attempt to connect. So it's <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/\">tcpdump</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ethereal.com/\">ethereal</a> to the rescue. They confirmed that Notes never did try to connect to the proxy, but was trying to do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address. The DNS in Leipzig must be broken, the lookup fails. When Stefan entered the hostname of the proxy instead of the IP address, the download worked. Even though the instructions say to enter an IP address. Go figure.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"My Chaotic Life",date:"17 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-17-my-chaotic-life/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Electoral Shift",date:"20 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-20-electoral-shift/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"My Chaotic Life",date:"17 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-17-my-chaotic-life/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Mama's in Munich for 'media training' until tomorrow night, and Christopher is at his substitute <em>Tagesmutter</em> Petra, since Heidi is at a conference. Petra usually doesn't work afternoons, but keeps Christopher until 5 pm as a favor to us. So I make an extra effort to pick him up on time. Except this afternoon on the <em>Autobahn</em>, I hear a strange clunking from the back of my car just after the <em>Elbtunnel</em>. Pull off into an industrial area, and sure enough, the right rear tire has blown. No sweat, pull out the spare tire, get the car up on the jack, and pull off the bad wheel. It won't budge. It's stuck as if it were welded on.</p>\n<p>Time to start getting creative. Call the auto club. Call Mama, who has Petra's number. Call Petra. Wait. Call Mama's sister-in-law to pick Christopher up... not home. Call Oma... she's home, and can pick him up. Call Petra to say Oma will pick up Christopher, and will even bring him to our house. A hour has gone by. Call auto club again, I'm next in line. Wait. There's the auto club car, but doesn't come to me He stops across the street! A guy there apparently called first. Wait half an hour for the auto club man to fix his Audi. </p>\n<p>At 7 pm, 2 hours after my first call, the auto club car finally crosses the street to me. My wheel is rusted tight, says the auto club man. He pulls out a hammer and a piece of wood, and after about a dozen hits the wheel finally starts to budge. Change tire, fill out auto club form, call Mama to say everything is alright, call Oma to say I'm on my way, and arrive home 2-3/4 hours late. Christopher was nearly asleep, but wakes up when he hears me, takes an hour to settle down, and falls asleep on the couch instead of in bed.</p>\n<p>This wouldn't have been at all possible to manage without a cell phone. There wasn't a pay phone anywhere near where I stopped. And in case you're wondering why my posts are few and far between and why I'm still using the b2 default layout... stop wondering.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"World Series Tickets",date:"16 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-16-world-series-tickets/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Ping On You",date:"18 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-18-ping-on-you/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:830,pageCount:1101}}}});
