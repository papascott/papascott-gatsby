At 20 cents per 50-cent roll, that's a good profit margin... for the bank, not us. </p>\n<p>Strangely, we always have to buy 1-cent and 1-Euro coins, but we always have a surplus of 2-cent and 2-Euro coins.</p>",fields:{title:"20 Cents Per Roll",date:"12 Oct 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-10-12-20-cents-per-roll/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-10-12-20-cents-per-roll/",prev:{fields:{title:"Broken Window",date:"05 Oct 2007",slug:"/2007-10-05-broken-window/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Help Wanted",date:"12 Oct 2007",slug:"/2007-10-12-help-wanted/"}}}}}});
