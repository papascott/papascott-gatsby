No, but as of August 4 they will discontinue the afternoon broadcast at 6pm, leaving only the early morning broadcast at 7:30. For families with working parents (like us!),  TV in the morning is not an option, and cutting the afternoon broadcast is as good as cancelling the show altogether. <a title="Radio Hamburg" href="http://www.radiohh.de/">Radio Hamburg</a> (a private broadcaster, as opposed to the public NDR) has launched a <a title="Radio Hamburg: Rettet die Sesamstrasse!" href="http://www.radiohh.de/neu/frameset/sites/dynamisch.html?ID=2974&subnavi1=10&page=info">campaign</a> to save the afternoon broadcast. NDR claims that the <a href="http://www.kika.de/">Kinderkanal</a> offers an alternative for children, but sorry, it\'s not Sesame Street, and it\'s a raw deal for Christopher.
