We had about 16 parents and 8 children marching in the drizzle through the fields with paper lanterns. We set up hay bales and some Halloween decorations in the carport, and offered pretzels and warm drinks. The kids played in the back yard, pretending it was not dark. Most of Heidi\'s kids are younger than 3, so most of the guests headed home by 8 pm.  A hard core stayed a little longer.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/jacques.jpg" border="0" height="180" width="135" alt="jacques.jpg" /></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Chilling out the Burger King",date:"16 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-16-chilling-out-the-burger-king/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Conquerors or Liberators Revisited",date:"17 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-17-conquerors-or-liberators-revisited/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Chilling out the Burger King",date:"16 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-16-chilling-out-the-burger-king/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a href="http://ahawkins.org/archives.html#note_241" title="code: theWebSocket;">code: theWebSocket: Chilling out the Burger King</a> "One of my patients had been having it his way down at the local Burger King when the elephant joined him for lunch and made itself at home on his chest..."
