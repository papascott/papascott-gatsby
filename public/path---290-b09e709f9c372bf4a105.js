Americans do it better and more often. I\'ve moved 12 times in my adult life, including cross-country and trans-continental, and 8 times since getting married (we can attest that moving is a good stress test for any relationship, although not nearly as good as building a house together). Moving is somewhat easier in the States since American apartments tend to include amenities like closets, floor covering, light fixtures and a kitchen, and are usually available (and can be vacated) at short notice. </p>\n<p>To answer a specific question: <a href="http://umzug.lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=20" title="Praktische &Uuml;berlegungen">how long can one live without a kitchen?</a> Answer: 10 weeks. Due to the physical constraints of the space-time continuum, when we moved to Germany we brought 4 suitcases and 3 cats with us on the plane and our furniture arrived 10 weeks later. We first moved temporarily into a unrenovated 6th-floor apartment in downtown Kiel, our first experience without the aforementioned amenities of closets, floor covering, light fixtures and a kitchen. We begged, borrowed, and bought from 2nd hand shops, and somehow survived until the container with our furniture arrived and found a permanent apartment in Hamburg. We\'d never want to do it again, but if we had to we\'d skip the shipping container and instead set up a credit line at Ikea.</p>\n<p>At the time we didn\'t yet have a child, which I imagine would increase the number of problems by at least a power of 2.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Bad Tickets",date:"09 Aug 2005",slug:"/2005-08-09-bad-tickets/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Want to go for a slide?",date:"11 Aug 2005",slug:"/2005-08-11-want-to-go-for-a-slide/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Bad Tickets",date:"09 Aug 2005",slug:"/2005-08-09-bad-tickets/",tags:"Y2005"},html:'<p>My wife\'s company has been sponsoring the <a href="http://www.hsv.de/">local soccer team</a> for I don\'t know how many years now, and today for the first time she brought home match tickets.
