The US State Department has tightened the rules on parental consent, and both parents must sign the application in person. A notarized consent form is no longer accepted unless it is physically impossible for the parent to appear. "In prison" was the example we were given. "Being a busy businesswoman" doesn\'t cut it. Luckily Christopher has a understanding if busy mother, so Christopher\'s application will have the missing signature within a few days.</p>\n<p>The information on <a href="http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/services/passport_issuance.html">germany.usembassy.gov</a> is somewhat confusing on this point, but now that I\'ve given my constructive feedback, I\'m sure they\'ll get the details fixed soon. :-)</p>',fields:{title:"The Barking/Braying/Meowing/Crowing Manhole Cover in Bremen",date:"18 Nov 2008",url:"https://papascott.de/2008-11-18-the-barkingbrayingmeowingcrowing-manhole-cover-in-bremen/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2008-11-18-the-barkingbrayingmeowingcrowing-manhole-cover-in-bremen/",prev:{fields:{title:"Paper Chase",date:"15 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-15-paper-chase/"}},next:{fields:{title:"The Iceman Cometh",date:"22 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-22-the-iceman-cometh/"}}}}}});
