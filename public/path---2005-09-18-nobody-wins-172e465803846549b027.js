Both SPD and Union lost several percent compared to 2002, neither Red/Green nor Block/Yellow has a majority. The big winners are the neo-liberal FDP (over 10%) and the neo-socialist Left/PDS (over 8%). The most likely result is a grand coalition of Union and SPD, a coalition of losers. </p>\n<p>Heiko wonders about a <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/003369.shtml" title="Jamaica coalition by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">Jamaica coalition</a> of Union/FDP/Greens.
