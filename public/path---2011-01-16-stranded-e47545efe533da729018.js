It will be my company car for the next three years. Our family isn\'t really big enough for a mini-van, but there are times we need the space, either for business or for pleasure. I\'d love to show it to you, but right now all I have is this fuzzy smartphone photo...</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sharan.jpg" alt="sharan.jpg" border="0" width="450" height="338" /></p>\n<p>...because the day after we picked up the car, with 325 km on the odometer, it had to be towed from the Autobahn to the shop!</p>\n<p>I was on my way to LÃ¼neburg to pick up our son from school for an appointment, enjoying the music from the very loud speakers, when at 180 km/h the (manual) transmission suddenly popped out of gear and wouldn\'t go back in. All I could do was coast to the side of the road and call for help, and arrange for an alternate pick-up for our son. My wife was out of town, so she couldn\'t step in (but she did contact her brother to pick up our son from the bus, and I was able to reach the school to tell him to take the bus instead of waiting for me).</p>\n<p>The next day I was told that the transmission was blocked for some unexplained reason and will be completely replaced. The car will probably be ready on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>I must say that VW Service performed as well as I could expect. Within 30 minutes I was being towed to the nearest VW dealer, and 1 hour later I was on my way home with a free loaner car.</p>\n<p>We\'ve leased all our cars from Volkswagen since starting our business, even for the franchisee herself, and we have a good relationship with our local VW dealer. We\'re sure this is a one-off problem, and even if not we\'ll be able to resolve it to our satisfaction. But I have to admit I\'ll be a bit hesitant the first time I bring the Sharan to full speed when we have it back.</p>',fields:{title:"Stranded!",date:"16 Jan 2011",url:"https://papascott.de/2011-01-16-stranded/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2011-01-16-stranded/",prev:{fields:{title:"Back in Black",date:"12 Jan 2011",slug:"/2011-01-12-back-in-black/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Save the World",date:"05 Feb 2011",slug:"/2011-02-05-save-the-world/"}}}}}});
