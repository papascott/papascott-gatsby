Brötchen with strawberry jelly, but please hold the Brötchen.

(Spouses were also invited, but we felt that Christopher is too young yet to leave with a babysitter for 4 days, so the men are staying home.) But on Saturday afternoon, her brother and his wife are celebrating their 10th anniversary with a <a href="http://www.ms-stadt-kiel.de/">chartered cruise</a> in the Kiel Bay. And looking at the flight plans, there is no way to get from Verona to Kiel in time for the cruise. Not unless she charters a helicopter. I don\'t suppose <a href="http://www.curry.com/">Adam Curry</a> will loan us his.</p>\n<p>Travel plans: We\'ll be in Minnesota for 3 weeks in December to celebrate Christmas and Christopher\'s second birthday, returning before New Year\'s. Next spring, Mama has a meeting in Las Vegas the last week of April. Christopher and I will tag along, and the authorities in Vegas have been <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$901">warned</a>. We\'ll probably also swing through the West Coast, so that Mama won\'t be able to complain anymore that I\'ve never taken her to San Francisco.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Day Off",date:"17 Aug 2001",slug:"/2001-08-17-day-off/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Monkeylars",date:"20 Aug 2001",slug:"/2001-08-20-monkeylars/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Day Off",date:"17 Aug 2001",slug:"/2001-08-17-day-off/",tags:"Y2001"},html:"<p>Mama and Christopher are off to Oma Ruth's today, to give her some help for her move at the end of September.
