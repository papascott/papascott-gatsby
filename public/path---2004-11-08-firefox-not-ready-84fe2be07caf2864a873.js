The release candidates for the Mac have been somewhat stable, but are still worse than 0.9.x. And they stil render certain GIFs improperly, like PhotoMatt\'s header and the star images at Amazon, at least for me. And under Linux, Firefox chokes, and sometimes freezes, on mistyped hostnames with slow DNS lookups. Maybe it works better on Windows, but I fear the <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/4891">hype</a> is going to backfire. It\'s not ready.</p>',fields:{title:"Firefox not ready",date:"08 Nov 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-11-08-firefox-not-ready/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-11-08-firefox-not-ready/",prev:{fields:{title:"But you're not white",date:"08 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-08-but-youre-not-white/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Global Reach",date:"08 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-08-global-reach/"}}}}}});
