So I'm giving them a try. I'm importing their HTML directly for now, rather than groking RSS, but it still doesn't look bad at all.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Movable Type 2.5",date:"08 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-08-movable-type-25/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"papascott.com",date:"09 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-09-papascottcom/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Movable Type 2.5",date:"08 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-08-movable-type-25/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>I've moved away from Movable Type, but I'm still happy and excited to see <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/25/#about25\">Movable Type 2.5</a>.

Mama has a convention in Sydney on her calendar for 2004, so she might get a chance to return the favor. Rudi was regretting missing the <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyleague/story/0,10069,805946,00.html">National Rugby League final</a> (and will be disappointed that New Zealand lost).
