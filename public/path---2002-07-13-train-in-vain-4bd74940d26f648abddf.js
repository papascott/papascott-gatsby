I was Christopher\'s hero of the day, or at least for the hour.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow if the weather is good we\'ll go to Hamburg\'s zoo <a href="http://www.hagenbeck.de/"> Tierpark Hagenbeck</a>. Christopher can name most of the classic zoo animals, so he should have a good time.<br />\n <b>Update:</b> We decided to stay home, due to drizzle and lack of energy. We\'ll go some other time.</p>',fields:{title:"Train In Vain",date:"13 Jul 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-07-13-train-in-vain/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-07-13-train-in-vain/",prev:{fields:{title:"German women keep glass ceiling intact",date:"13 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-13-german-women-keep-glass-ceiling-intact/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Sunlog and uni.tb",date:"14 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-14-sunlog-and-unitb/"}}}}}});
