He\'s not Howard Dean, he\'s a quiet party insider. While I might want Dean on my side in a street fight, I would only want Mirow on my side in a room full of accountants. As for the weblog itself, the (anonymous) fluffy postings remind me of the pseudo \'weblog\' at <a title="GeorgeWBush.com :: Official Blog" href="http://www.georgewbush.com/blog/">GeorgeWBush.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The weblog doesn\'t seem to fit in the SPD campaign concept of focusing on issues in contrast to Pretty Boy von Buest. I have the feeling the weblog was started because a couple of techies  thought it would be cool to have a weblog, rather than being part of a well thought-out campaign strategy.</p>\n<p>If the Hamburg SPD had been serious about using weblogs as a politcial tool, they would have started six months ago, before the self-destruction of the CDU/Schill/FDP coaliition, not just 35 days before the election. Now, it will just be lost in the whole \'campaign internet presence\'. They don\'t even a link to to weblog at the main campaign site. To be fair, the weblog went online ahead of schedule, and may yet develop into something interesting and useful. But for now, it\'s neither.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, after Die Zeit it\'s yet another coup for the Hamburg blogging service blogg.de.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"",date:"24 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-24-how-do-i-bring-my-fiancee-to-the-united-states/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Windmill Poster",date:"24 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-24-windmill-poster/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"",date:"24 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-24-how-do-i-bring-my-fiancee-to-the-united-states/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="It\'s more complicated than when I did it" href="http://uscis.gov/graphics/howdoi/fiance.htm">US CIS: How Do I Bring My Fiancé(e) to the United States?</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"I Am The Walrus",date:"22 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-22-i-am-the-walrus/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Mirow Blog",date:"24 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-24-mirow-blog/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"I Am The Walrus",date:"22 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-22-i-am-the-walrus/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>Two years ago we had 5 network sysadmins at our company. Last year we had 3. One left last month, another broke her arm and is out sick, and third one is me. And I am alone until my colleague can peck at a keyboard. And our network is no less complex than when there were 5 of us. Until now I've had nothing to do with our internal routing, I was strictly external. Up until last month I deferred firewall requests to my more knowledgable colleagues. Now, I <em>am</em> the firewall.</p>\n<p>I've been able to fake my way through most problems. A couple of routing problems I was not able to fake my through, and thus I was able to \"gain valuable experience\" (i.e. learn by screwing up). Hint: a router sends packets exactly how it is told. If it isn't told where to find an address, the packets disappear, just like luggage at the airport without a checkin tag . My co-workers are at least sympathetic than I am covering bases for 3 peopel. But my brain hurts at the end of the day. </p>\n<p>There is hope on the horizon.
