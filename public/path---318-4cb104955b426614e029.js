I'd have a good one too, from a few years ago, but I didn't know it was lost. A couple days after returning from a trip to the States, I couldn't locate my passport. It couldn't be that far away, I obviously had it in my hand when I entered the country. I assumed I had misplaced it when unpacking, and that it would eventually show up.</p>\n<p>After a couple of weeks, it hadn't shown up, and I submitted an application for a replacement to the consulate. They called me to say that they had my old passport, so I wouldn't need a new one. Someone had found it at the airport parking lot and had put in a mailbox, and the post sent it to the consulate. Which goes to show that sometimes when something is missing, maybe you really have lost it.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Impact Blog",date:"29 Apr 2005",slug:"/2005-04-29-impact-blog/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Multilateral Lasagne",date:"30 Apr 2005",slug:"/2005-04-30-multilateral-lasagne/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Impact Blog",date:"29 Apr 2005",slug:"/2005-04-29-impact-blog/",tags:"Y2005"},html:'<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bdinphoenix/1357851/"><img src="http://photos2.flickr.com/1357851_6aec366e02_t.jpg" border="0" align="right" /></a>J&ouml;rg earnestly asks <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2005/04/29.html#buzzwordalarm" title="Der Schockwellenreiter: Weblog-Archiv 29.04.2005">"What is an \'impact blog\'?"</a> To me it\'s obvious... it\'s a blog that makes a <a href="http://www.meteorcrater.com/" title="Meteor Crater - Experience the Impact!">big hole</a>.
