They finished last in the group with no wins, and have gone home. The last time Germany finished a major tournement without a win was in 1938. As would be expected in a country where arrogance is a national attribute, the media is treating this as a major disaster. </p>\n<p><b>Shopping trip</b> Highlight of the day today was a trip to Lüneburg to the Baby One shop to look for a crib and a baby phone. We would have bought the crib, they don\'t deliver, and to fit the crib in the Fiat one of us would have had to stay in Lüneburg.</p>\n<p><b>It\'s Official</b> We\'ll be flying to the States for three weeks this fall to visit friends and family.
