These latter reactions are wholly inappropriate. Spain is not America, but it is an ally, and a representative democracy. It is not our place to criticize whom our allies select to be their leaders, so long as the elections are free and fair, and democracy is not undermined.

For his loyalty, he deserves our undying gratitude. Muchas gracias, Se√±or Aznar."</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"CeBIT Optional",date:"16 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-16-cebit-optional/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Helden",date:"17 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-17-helden/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"CeBIT Optional",date:"16 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-16-cebit-optional/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>Just for the record, I won\'t be at the <a title="CeBIT - Homepage Englisch" href="http://www.cebit.de/homepage_e?x=1">CeBIT</a> this year, even though <a title="BlogMeet at CeBIT by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001897.shtml">several Hamburg bloggers</a> will be atttending the world\'s largest cattle stampede, er, I mean computer and IT trade show in Hannover (insert gratuitous Hannover joke here).
