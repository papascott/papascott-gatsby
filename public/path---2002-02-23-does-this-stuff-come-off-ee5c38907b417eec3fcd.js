There live roughly 80,000 people. The German winter athletes are recruited from these 80,000 people, not from the 80 million German population. The succeses were all in endurance and strength disciplines (cross-country, speed skating). In the technical contests (alpine skiing, ice hockey, figure skating) the results were as usual. In cycling (Ullrich, Zabel), I had always wondered how long the DDR doping advantage would last. This was the wrong question, of course.
