The Economist article is especially good, since it points out how special treatment for <em>Sparkassen</em> (savings banks) skews the whole domestic banking sector. Most of our customers are <em>Sparkassen</em> (or their IT <a href="http://www.dvg.de/">outsourcers</a>), with the notable exception of the <a href="http://www.postbank.de/">Postbank</a>, yet another special case in the banking market.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the preliminary results are in, and it looks like that 90% of my co-workers did indeed agree to the pay and vacation reduction for this quarter. I guess many, like me, waited until the last minute. So management got what they wanted, we\'ll see what happens. I\'m cautiously pessimistc.

We have to organize our own from now on.</p>',fields:{title:"Tomorrow Calling",date:"22 Oct 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-10-22-tomorrow-calling/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-10-22-tomorrow-calling/",prev:{fields:{title:"Down and Out",date:"22 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-22-down-and-out/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Where's The Kite?",date:"23 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-23-wheres-the-kite/"}}}}}});
