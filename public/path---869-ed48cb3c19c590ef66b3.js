In Germany, rainfall is measured in liters per square meter, which have satisfied my childhood sense of logic. And can easily be converted to linear units, since a liter is (10 cm)<sup>3</sup>, 1 l/m<sup>2</sup> is equal to 1 mm of rainfall. </p>\n<p>I say all this only because it has been raining all week, and it's raining again today. Our part of northern Germany received 150 l/m<sup>2</sup> (6 inches) within a few hours a couple of days ago, Some towns near us (Soltau, Buxtehude, Stade) were flooded, the dike along the Elbe in Drochtersen (where Mama's brother Roland lives) threatened to break, and the highway in Horneburg (near Buxtehude, the route we drive to visit Roland) is still flooded out. along with several homes.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Bear and Fish",date:"21 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-21-bear-and-fish/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Strange Things That Break",date:"21 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-21-strange-things-that-break/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Bear and Fish",date:"21 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-21-bear-and-fish/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Christopher's current favorite book is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307118398/qid=1027286549/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-5918059-1772644\">Just Me and My Dad</a>, a Little Critter book by <a href=\"http://www.littlecritter.com/about_mercer_mayer.html\">Mercer Mayer</a> he got from our friend Karen in Arizona.

He'll even pound on the page with his hands to try to fight the bear off. </p>\n<p>I noticed this weekend that his jabbering now consists of over 50% real German or English words that adults can understand. Maybe he's talking only just as much as he always has, but I can understand more and more of what he is saying, so he's catching my attention more often. And I realize that he is still learning about 10 times as fast as I can, and that he's talking about all the new things he is learning. That's scary, and at the same time exciting. He could probably even solve this problem of installing the current php-xmldom on Mandrake Linux via rpm I've been fighting all weekend.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Around The World in 30 Days",date:"19 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-19-around-the-world-in-30-days/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"It's Raining Men",date:"21 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-21-its-raining-men/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Around The World in 30 Days",date:"19 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-19-around-the-world-in-30-days/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Mark Pilgrim has now <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/19.html#day_30_creating_an_accessibility_statement">completed</a> his series <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_weblog/index.html">30 days to a more accessible weblog</a>.
