Strangely enough, Christopher found the flat portions of the trail boring and exhausting, but thought it was great fun to crawl over boulders on the middle portion of the trail. We\'ll remember to take him only on difficult trails in the future.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2955192713" title="View \'CIMG0598\' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://static.flickr.com/3194/2955192713_08d714b612_m.jpg" alt="CIMG0598" border="0" width="" height="" /></a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Easy Morning for Free Update",date:"15 Oct 2008",slug:"/2008-10-15-easy-morning-for-free-update/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Easy Morning in Words and Pictures",date:"22 Oct 2008",slug:"/2008-10-22-easy-morning-in-words-and-pictures/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Easy Morning for Free Update",date:"15 Oct 2008",slug:"/2008-10-15-easy-morning-for-free-update/",tags:"Y2008"},html:'<p>Just a note that our Easy Morning for Free was a huge success, and we have the newspaper article scanned in at <a href="http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/2008/10/easy-morning-for-free-ein-voller-erfolg/">our restaurant homepage</a> (or click on the picture for a pdf).
