Good thing I\'ve been paying attention, I had my answers ready.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Total amount of music files on your computer:</strong><br />\n<code>moneyball:~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music shanson$ du -sh<br /> <br />\n6.5G</code></p>\n<p><strong>2. The last CD you bought was:</strong><br />\nDepends on what you mean by CD...<br />\nThe last physical CD I bought was Christmas music for Christopher: "Weihnachten im Kindergarten" by Rolf Zuckowski. The last album I bought at iTunes Music Store was "Gold Medal" by The Donnas last November. The last album I bought at allofmp3.com was "Greatest Hits" by The Bangles last week. </p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the song you last listened to before reading this message?</strong><br />\n"My Love Will Not Let You Down" by Bruce Springsteen.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Write down 5 songs you often listen to or that mean a lot to you.</strong><br />\n"The River" by Bruce Springsteen<br />\n"Best Friend\'s Girl" by The Cars<br />\n"When U Were Mine" by Prince<br />\n"Mach Die Augen Zu" by Die &Auml;rzte<br />\n"Nur Getr&auml;umt" by Nena  </p>\n<p>These are all "I\'ve lost my love and now I\'ve lost my mind" songs, except for Nena. And "Downbound Train" would a more fitting Springsteen song, but I like "The River" better.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Who are you going to pass this stick to? (3 persons) and why?</strong><br />\nDon\'t know yet... most everyone I read has already done this.</p>',fields:{title:"Five Questions",date:"21 Feb 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-02-21-five-questions/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-02-21-five-questions/",prev:{fields:{title:"Schleswig-Holstein Votes",date:"20 Feb 2005",slug:"/2005-02-20-schleswigholstein-votes/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Schleswig-Holstein Counts the Votes",date:"21 Feb 2005",slug:"/2005-02-21-schleswigholstein-counts-the-votes/"}}}}}});
