In western Germany just 5% of the mothers with pre-kindergarten children work full time, and just 16% of mothers of children in elementary school. And how many mothers are responsible for tens of millions of monthly revenue and several thousand employees? I personally found the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,145177,00.html">story</a> about <a href="http://www.msco.org">Sherrif Joe</a> from Phoenix and his tent jails and chain gangs entertaining.
