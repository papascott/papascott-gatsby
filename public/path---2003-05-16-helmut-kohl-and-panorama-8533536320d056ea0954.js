He hated them, and they hated him back. So Dr. Kohl was not particularly cooperative when the ARD magazine Panorama wanted to ask him about his DM100,000+ consulting contract with the private broadcaster (now bankrupt) Leo Kirch. But the <a href=\"http://www.ndrtv.de/panorama/20030515/kirch.html\">'interview'</a> could be a lesson to politicians everywhere in dealing with pesky reporters...</p>\n<p>ARD Panorama: Herr Dr. Kohl, good day. Stuchlik, Panorama, one question. Why did you receive money from Mr. Kirch?<br />\nDr. Helmut Kohl: I have absolutely no intention of giving you an interview.<br />\nPanorama: Why not?<br />\nKohl: You are from Panorama?<br />\nPanorama: Yes.<br />\nKohl: That means you have nothing to do with journalism.<br />\nPanorama: But why did you receive...?<br />\nKohl: Oh, man, that's enough.<br />\nPanorama: For what services did you receive the money?<br />\nKohl: That I look at your face, and that's enough for me.<br />\nPanorama: I ask once again: Why did you receive money from Mr. Kirch?<br />\nKohl: I can tell you this. I am collecting money to finance an investigation of the liars and traitors of German unity, in connection with certain activities of the ARD.<br />\nPanorama: That means you are accusing us of betraying our country?<br />\nKohl: Parts of the ARD and the activities of especially your program over the years. I wanted to tell you this, and you can broadcast it live. Of course I'm accusing some of you of treason, there's no other word for it.</p>\n<p>Lesson learned: when in doubt, accuse the press of treason! I missed the broadcast, but laughed long, hard and loud when I heard it on the radio.
