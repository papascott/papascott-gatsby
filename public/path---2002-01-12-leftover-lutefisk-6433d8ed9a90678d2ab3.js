Namely, <a href="http://jonasbeckman.editthispage.com">Jonas</a> (from Stockholm) <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$811?mode=day">wrote</a>  "Unfortunately, Swedes don\'t have more sense than that. Thanks for thinking we should, though. We call it lutfisk - and in fact I often eat it during Christmas. But I do stay clear of <a href="http://www.svensson.com/norge/sur1.htm">surstr√∂mming</a>." (Warning: follow this link at your own risk! Ed.)</p>\n<p>I also read a newspaper article from Seattle (but I no longer have the link) about a restaurant that would <i>not</i> be serving lutefisk this year (which was certainly a disappointment to certain residents of the Ballard neighborood). It mentioned the Norsefest in Madison, MN, and wondered if the lutefisk eating contest and the outhouse race there had something to do with one another.</p>\n<p>Lutefisk was, however, still available at certain <a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2001/12/30">fine shops in Iowa</a>.<br />\n<hr />\nEveryone else may be working with <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a> today, but today was my day for laying cable. Twisted pair ethernet cable, that is... from our home office, through the wall to Christopher\'s room, down a PVC pipe in the wall two stories to the basement. I even crimped on the ends myself, and added a second hub. All I can say is... it worked, first try. I\'m posting from the basement right now. And now I know the <a href="http://www.escape.ca/~droopy/ethernetcables.html">pin outs</a> of the 8 wires in a twisted pair cable: white-orange, orange, white-green, blue, white-blue, green, white-brown, brown.
