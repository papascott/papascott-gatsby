He told us what we already suspected: Christopher has fluid behind the eardrums in both ears, his adenoids are enlarged, and he is a classic candidate for an adenoidectomy. I was surprised that he recommended surgery right away (I had a similar operation at age 8), but doing some reading I learned that such a procedure at age 4 is not unusual, and these days can be done as an out-patient. We\'ve made an appointment for the end of the month. We also had a hearing test done, but since Christopher was somewhat uncooperative, the results were inconclusive. He only hears what he wants to hear. Don\'t we all?</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)",date:"06 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-06-federal-voting-assistance-program-fvap/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"ARD Tagesschau: News in English",date:"07 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-07-ard-tagesschau-news-in-english/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)",date:"06 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-06-federal-voting-assistance-program-fvap/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="Absentee ballot information and applications for overseas citizens" href="http://www.fvap.gov/">Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Pay Attention!",date:"04 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-04-pay-attention/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Otitis Media",date:"06 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-06-otitis-media/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Pay Attention!",date:"04 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-04-pay-attention/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>This is what I get for not paying attention.
