This involved drilling holes in our beloved free-standing wooden staircase, which we really wanted to avoid. But the staircase is not sturdy enough for metal tension gate we got from Ikea. So we have to live with the holes. I decided to use bolts instead of wood screws. Hopefully the clean hole will be easier to patch later.</p>\n<p>The aim of all this is to for Christopher to be able to stay upstairs semi-attended, so that I can work one day a week at home after Mama goes back to work in January. We've arranged for 3 days of day-care per week. I'll work at home on Mondays, and Mama will arrange to have either Wednesday or Friday off and then to work a weekend day.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Election",date:"08 Nov 2000",slug:"/2000-11-08-election/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Too long gone",date:"20 Nov 2000",slug:"/2000-11-20-too-long-gone/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:1034,pageCount:1101}}}});
