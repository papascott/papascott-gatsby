He always has been, but lately it has been extreme. He has to have an undershirt, a white, sleeveless undershirt. He has to have overalls, with pockets, they are his 'railroad pants'. And he has to have his kite socks, of which we only have one pair. We have to trick Christopher to be able to wash them, or wait until he is asleep. That's why the first thing Mama said when I woke up this morning was \"I can't find the kite socks.\" They were on the radiator in the bathroom. I had put them there to dry.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Generic Links",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-generic-links/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Klappe!",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-klappe/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Generic Links",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-generic-links/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>As I <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.html">threatened</a> to do a couple of days ago, I\'ve converted all the internal links to a generic /YYYY/MM/DD format.

In index.php, the individual link is now <code>&lt;a href="&lt;?php the_time(\'/Y/m/d/\');the_id(); ?>.html"></code>. b2archives.php had to be adjusted to output the new monthly archive links. The *_popup_link functions output relative links that are now wrong in the archive pages. I had to adjust them to add a slash at the beginning of the href. Just for fun, I made the date headline into a link to a daily archive.
