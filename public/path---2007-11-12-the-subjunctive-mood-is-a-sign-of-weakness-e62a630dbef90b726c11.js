I\'ve recently discovered that the same principle can apply to "yes".</p>\n<p>Recently in a hotel Frauke mislaid her cell phone and sent me to the reception desk to check if anyone had found it. Indeed, a cell phone had been found, and it looked very similar to Frauke\'s phone, and I was asked if it was her phone. I couldn\'t be sure, though, without opening the case, so trying to be friendly and polite I replied "Yes, it could be." <em>(Ja, es k&ouml;nnte sein.)</em></p>\n<p>This was not accepted as an affirmative reply. I forget the exact response, but it was along the lines of "Well are you sure or are you not?" or "Is that supposed to be yes or no?" I had to start over and say that Frauke\'s name would appear on the display when it was turned on, and that would prove whether it was her phone or not.</p>\n<p>In Germany it pays to be sure of yourself, even when you\'re not. Arrogance here is not a negative attribute, but rather a prerequisite. :-)</p>',fields:{title:"The Subjunctive Mood is a Sign of Weakness",date:"12 Nov 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-11-12-the-subjunctive-mood-is-a-sign-of-weakness/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-11-12-the-subjunctive-mood-is-a-sign-of-weakness/",prev:{fields:{title:"Why Didn't You Park There?",date:"09 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-09-why-didnt-you-park-there/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Find The Entrance",date:"16 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-16-find-the-entrance/"}}}}}});
