It\'s Christopher\'s first road trip. (But don\'t expect any updates on her home page for the next few days... I doubt if she has time to stop by the Internet café.)</p>\n<p>This was the top news story in Germnay today. MS<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/375933.asp">Germans hold U.S. teens over deaths</a>:  "Prosecutors asked for murder charges Tuesday against three U.S. teenagers accused of tossing rocks from a highway bridge at passing cars, killing two drivers"</p>\n<p>The media here is not making a big deal that the teenagers are American. There have been a dozen similar incidents in the past 10 years involving German youth causing injury or death to drivers by throwing objects from bridges.</p>\n<p>I was going to write something about Amazon\'s patent last night, but instead I told <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$113">Andrea</a> about how at the beginning of our relationship Mama and I stayed in touch from separate contintents, before there was an Internet, or even cheap international phone calls. (Actually, I just wanted her to tell her story of how she and André <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$117">met via the Internet</a>.) </p>\n<p>I\'ve been fiddling with my ISDN connection at home, trying to get it to work with FreeBSD, so I\'ve been mostly offline the past couple of days. I did give Mama my spare ISDN card, though, so she could stay online.</p>',fields:{title:"CeBIT Tuesday",date:"29 Feb 2000",url:"https://papascott.de/2000-02-29-cebit-tuesday/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2000-02-29-cebit-tuesday/",prev:{fields:{title:"CeBIT Saturday",date:"26 Feb 2000",slug:"/2000-02-26-cebit-saturday/"}},next:{fields:{title:"CeBIT Last Day",date:"01 Mar 2000",slug:"/2000-03-01-cebit-last-day/"}}}}}});
