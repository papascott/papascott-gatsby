He is now free to play a national role in the CDU. By \'pulling a Stoiber\' in Hamburg, von Beust must now be mentioned in the same breath as CDU stars like Koch and Wulff.</p>\n<p>And a new moderate CDU star strengthens Merkel\'s hand against the Lederhosen wing of the Union. I doubt that Stoiber will throw in the towel and move to Bellevue (i.e. accept the office of Bundespresident, removing him from political influence), but I do believe that the Union will take more moderate positions on issues like immigration and tax reform, and that this makes Merkel even more likely to be the next chancellor candidate.</p>\n<p>(Lightly ediited from a comment posted at <a title="Davids Medienkritik: German Socialists Suffer Crushing Election Loss in Hamburg" href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/german_socialis.html">Medienkritik</a>.)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Russell Beattie: Looking back at Spain",date:"01 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-01-russell-beattie-looking-back-at-spain/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"",date:"02 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-02-httpwwwsueddeutschede/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Russell Beattie: Looking back at Spain",date:"01 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-01-russell-beattie-looking-back-at-spain/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="what you see today isn\'t what you\'ll see tomorrow" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006477.html">Russell Beattie: Looking back at Spain</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Et tu, Ole?",date:"01 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-01-et-tu-ole/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"The Meaning of Hamburg",date:"01 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-01-the-meaning-of-hamburg/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Et tu, Ole?",date:"01 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-01-et-tu-ole/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="SPD-Horn: Nur Schill verhalf Beust zum Sieg" href="http://www.spd-horn.de/archives/000129.html#more">Via SPD-Horn:</a> <a title="Kommentar: Ein Meisterstück - FAZ.NET - Politik" href="http://www.faz.net/s/Rub7FC5BF30C45B402F96E964EF8CE790E1/Doc~E3D3AD39D7E0E4EF796EF107D881A8199~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html">Political conspiracy theory</a> from the FAZ.
