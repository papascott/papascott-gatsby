But when I go through <a href=\"http://www.anonymizer.com\">Anonymizer</a>, a proxy service located in California, the ads are gone. FAZ is somehow checking where you come from. (<b>Correction</b>: The ads do appear for Garret, <a href=\"http://www.dangerousmeta.com/discuss/00000272?expand_all=1\">he just overlooked them</a>.) The FAZ is too right-wing anyway.

Aviation (mainly Airbus and Lufthansa) is already the biggest industry in Hamburg (in terms of numbers of jobs), and Hamburg (behind Seattle and Toulouse) is the 3rd largest aviation city in the world.

They have a range of a couple hundred meters, but a speed of just 128K (OK for surfing, since we only have ISDN and we may never be able to get DSL). Total cost: DM 450, less than half the cost of two 11MBit \'Wireless Ethernet\' cards, never mind a base station.
