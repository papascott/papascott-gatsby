This piece from <a href="http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/2006/12/yesterdays_new_york_times_spec.cfm">Free Exchange</a> is worth a long quote.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Until recently, only a small minority in most Western European nations received any post secondary education, even though tuition was low or free in most places.  Ironically, the ideal of free education forced the government to institute rationing through non-price mechanisms, in this case by limiting the number of spaces at university.  Wealthier children were more likely to get the high exam scores necessary to secure one of these scarce slots.</p>\n<p>  Recently, these countries have tried to make higher education more widely available. Unfortunately, they have tried to do so on the cheap.  This has put a tremendous strain on the resources of these universities, and as a result many talented professors have decamped to America. But the mere mention of instituting or increasing fees incites mass demonstrations of students, who believe the only fair education is free education.</p>\n<p>  However, fee paying education does not seem to discourage attendance. According the National Centre for Public Policy and Higher Education, 39% of Americans between the ages of 35 to 64 hold a college degree, just behind Canada. This figure is only 25% in the UK, 23% in Germany, 19% in France, and 10% in Italy. They are shrinking towards par in the current generation, but there is no sign that free education is making Europeans more likely to attend college.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Speaking from experience, as a student money for education is a solvable problem... loans, part-time jobs, scholarships, or even joining the military. There are ways around it. But there is no way around not getting a spot in the first place because universities are underfunded.</p>\n<p>The trend in Germany right now is to start charging modest fees to students without actually increasing budgets, the quality of education or the number of students. In other words, it\'s the worst of both worlds.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Could Those Be Angels?",date:"12 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-12-could-those-be-angels/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Dragon Babies",date:"14 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-14-dragon-babies/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Could Those Be Angels?",date:"12 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-12-could-those-be-angels/",tags:"Y2006"},html:"<p>We've come to the conclusion that since the 4th Advent Sunday falls on Christmas Eve, Christmas is coming way too soon this year. We'd like to apply for a week's extension. </p>\n<p>Christopher has school up to Friday the 22nd, but his special activities (tumbling at school and stutter therapy) have the week before Christmas off, so he has extra time to get excited for Christmas. We adults do not. He's also signed up for the Christmas program at church. He was in a nativity play in Kindergarten last year, playing one of the main roles, Joseph. As a special ed Kindergarten, Mary was in a wheelchair, so he had to both speak lines and push Mary to the stage. This year he's happy to play a supporting role, namely a shepherd. He's got one line, with exactly 6 words:</p>\n<p>> And there! Could those be angels!? *(Und da! Sind das nicht Engel!?)*</p>\n<p>He was able to borrow a shepherd's staff (actually just a big stick) from church. We need to organize the rest of the costume (floppy hat, vest, dark pants) ourselves. We also have to bring him to dress rehearsal on Saturday the 23rd, which takes care of any last minute shopping we might need to do. We also need to show up early for church on Christmas Eve, but at least we should get good seats.</p>\n<p>And if he stutters well enough, he could well double his speaking part! (Yes, it's okay to joke about stuttering. We do it with Christopher all the time. He stutters with all kinds of frogs, sometimes with snakes, and sometimes even with a lawn mower that runs backwards! *Der rückwarts Rasenmäher!
