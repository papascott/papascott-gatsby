I cleared my own schedule and have the weekend off, but alas my time depends on two other schedules as well. I couldn't leave Christopher alone with Frauke on the weekend our construction starts getting serious, so we agreed that I would stay at home.</p>\n<p>Too bad. I haven't been to Dresden since 1995, and I'm sure a lot has changed since then. And now that they've build the A14 Autobahn between Magdeburg and Dresden, it's a lot easier to get to. Google Maps says it's a 4:20 drive, and Google forgets that Germany has no speed limit.</p>\n<p>In any case, I've tried to do some extra whining on PapaScott the past few weeks to make up for my absence. And once our McCaf&eacute; is up and running, maybe we can host a mini-meetup and invite some bloggers over for coffee and cake (sometime in the first half of 2008).</p>\n<p>In the meantime I've registered for the <a href=\"http://www.wordcamp08.de/\">German WordCamp conference in Hamburg</a> on January 27-28. One of my <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/GermanPermalinks\">plugins</a> in the German WordPress distribution, so I might still have some street cred regarding WordPress. My free time is tentative, so I might have to cancel at the last minute, but by then our business should have settled down somewhat.</p>",fields:{title:"PapaScott On Tour (Not)",date:"18 Nov 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-11-18-papascott-on-tour-not/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-11-18-papascott-on-tour-not/",prev:{fields:{title:"Customer Order Display",date:"17 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-17-customer-order-display/"}},next:{fields:{title:"You Can Say You To Me",date:"20 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-20-you-can-say-you-to-me/"}}}}}});
