And the tape in the vault is missing (Oma is out of town). And there is no Plan D. So I'm burning a vacation day today with Christopher. At least it's Mama's last trip for the fall, and she won't have another big trip until March.</p>",fields:{title:"Some Guys Have All The Luck",date:"21 Nov 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-11-21-some-guys-have-all-the-luck/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-11-21-some-guys-have-all-the-luck/",prev:{fields:{title:"News Flash - Politicians are Liars!",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-news-flash-politicians-are-liars/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Third Thursday in November",date:"21 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-21-third-thursday-in-november/"}}}}}});
