I thought that the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtimport.html">Movable Type Import Format</a> would be a good target, since it can be imported into many different weblogging systems.</p>\n<p>However, Manila had become more complicated in the meantime, and I was unable to quickly apply my script to Susan\'s files (i.e. I\'ve gotten stuck), and I\'m short of time. Since a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/15/Archive-Restore">number of people</a> had publicly offered to help export Manila sites, people with a probably a better understanding of Manila and XML than I have, I decided to plea for help via a Wiki page entitled <a href="http://www.papascott.de/ConvertingManila">ConvertingManila</a>.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>',fields:{title:"Converting Manila",date:"22 Jun 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-06-22-converting-manila/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-06-22-converting-manila/",prev:{fields:{title:"New Religion",date:"21 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-21-new-religion/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Manila: Converted",date:"24 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-24-manila-converted/"}}}}}});
