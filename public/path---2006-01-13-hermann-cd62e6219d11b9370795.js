Christopher brought him home from Kindergarten, and he seems to be a sourdough of some sort. If we treat him right, he will give birth to 3 Hermann-children, and we can bake a cake.</p>\n<p>Until then, though, he has to be cared for quite carefully.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day 1. Hermann needs rest. </li>\n<li>Days 2-4. Hermann needs exercise. Stir once each day.</li>\n<li>Day 5. Hermann is hungry! Feed him with 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. He then needs a bigger bowl, otherwise he will run away.</li>\n<li>Days 6-9. Hermann needs time to digest. He needs a daily walk. Stir once each day.</li>\n<li>Day 10. Feed again with 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He is then ready to give birth to 3 children (1 cup each, to be given to good friends), and with the rest we can bake a cake (recipe to follow, or just <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=86155837&amp;size=l" title="Photo Sharing">click</a> on the photo).</p>\n<p>Christopher has already memorized the instructions and is making sure we follow them to the letter. Today is Day 1, and despite the rest Hermann seems to have a bad case of gas. We\'ve had to open the cover several times.</p>',fields:{title:"Hermann",date:"13 Jan 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-01-13-hermann/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-01-13-hermann/",prev:{fields:{title:"It's Your Heimspiel",date:"12 Jan 2006",slug:"/2006-01-12-its-your-heimspiel/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Career Planning",date:"16 Jan 2006",slug:"/2006-01-16-career-planning/"}}}}}});
