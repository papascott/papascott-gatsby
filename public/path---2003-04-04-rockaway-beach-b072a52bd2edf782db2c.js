Luckily they don\'t "blast out the disco on the radio" like in the Ramones song. Sunny, quiet, and connected, thanks to a $10 one-month account at <a href="http://www.budgetdÃ­alup.com">Budget Dialup</a>, which is working more reliably than the big-time provider Mama uses to dial into her employer\'s VPN.</p>\n<p>I was going to get a pre-paid card for my spare cellphone (Motorola Timeport, cost &euro;13 used)  for the two weeks, but US cellular service is so expensive and confusing, I think I\'ll just pay the roaming charges for my German provider for the few times I\'m going to call. </p>\n<p>By the way, the WiFi on the Lufthansa flight was out of service, although they offered plain-old-ethernet. Mama used up her battery reading her mail at work, and they only offered electrical sockets in business and first class. Sitting in economy with a three-year-old is not a optimal environment for using a notebook anyway. Despite the fears of World Wide Klein, Lufthansa did not lose any of our luggage, but we only had two suitcases.</p>',fields:{title:"Rockaway Beach",date:"04 Apr 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-04-04-rockaway-beach/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-04-04-rockaway-beach/",prev:{fields:{title:"Master Builder",date:"02 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-02-master-builder/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Just A Note To Say...",date:"15 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-15-just-a-note-to-say/"}}}}}});
