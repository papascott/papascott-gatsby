Block E was the center of the squalor. The 620 Club in 1971 gave way to Moby Dick\'s, and became known as one of the city\'s most seedy bars. Unsavory establishments, including rough bars, flophouses, and an adult movie theater settled in on Block E in the 1970s and 1980s‚Ä¶</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the 1980s, the block was one of the choice places in Minneapolis for punks to hang out and it became a creative breeding ground for the local punk music scene. Block E was also known for its cheap rent, drawing such establishments as Rifle Sport Gallery. From the mid-1980s forward, the Minneapolis police had a constant presence in the area; it was normal to see squad cars or a police van parked between the northbound traffic lanes and contraflow bus lane.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Block E looked pretty much like this when I started college in Minneapolis in 1980. The owner-operator of the McDonald\'s was my wife\'s first boss, she  worked at the City Center location across the street.</p>\n<p>Block E was demolished in 1988 and became a parking lot.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Hard to Get",date:"17 Jan 2018",slug:"/2018-01-17-hard-to-get/",tags:"Y2018"},html:"<p>You'd think in the current German coalition talks that the SPD could at least <strong>play</strong> hard to get.</p>\n<p>Now I know German politics is a strange beast, but I would think that the SPD side more has more pull here.

Simple to write with, simple to work with.</p>\n<p>It's simple to write with. You just open the editor page and type. To update your text, you just click on it and type. There are some simple formatting options, but nothing that gets in the way. When you update, though WebSocket magic anyone reading your post immediately gets the update.</p>\n<p>And on the server it's <a href=\"http://my.1999.io/users/1999io/2016/04/11/0004.html\">simple to work with</a>. There's no database, just files in open formats readable as text, JSON, OPML, RSS, HTML. Formats you can use for other purposes if you are so inclined. Even the HTML files for each post contain the JSON for the post, which I first thought was redundant but now see is brilliant. It's like the web page contains it's own DNA and can re-create itself.¬†</p>\n<p>These open formats allow one to do things with the output that go beyond the server. For instance, I copy the output of my server to an S3 bucket at <a href=\"http://1999.papascott.de\">1999.papascott.de</a>, which can probably handle load better than my cheap VPS :smile:.

I <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/04/30/see-what-sticks/">mentioned then</a> that it took Jekyll some 3 minutes to render my 3000 or so blog posts, which is kind of a drag since the default is to rebuild the entire site every time even a small change is made.</p>\n<p>Actually, the latest version of Jekyll improved build times considerably. It can now build my 3000 pages in about a minute. But when making changes, that\'s still too long to wait.</p>\n<p>However, using a trick, I can now build those 3000 pages in 4 seconds. The trick seems pretty obvious to me, but I\'ve not seen it written up anyplace, so hence this post.</p>\n<p>The trick, of course, is to <em>not</em> build all 3000 pages. For older posts use <a href="https://jquery.com/">jquery</a> to load in parts of the layout that might change, but leave the HTML file alone. For me, those parts are the sidebar and the recent posts. I build HTML snippets for those divs and load them in like:</p>\n<pre><code>$( "#sidebar" ).load( "/includes/sidebar.html" );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Right now, on the Jekyll side I don\'t want it to rebuild posts from before 2015. I\'ve put all those in a _posts/older subdirectory and added an exclude: directive in my _config.yml:</p>\n<pre><code>exclude: [_posts/older]\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the HTML side, ever since I started blogging, even way-back-when with <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/12/08/editthispagecom.html">EditThisPage</a>, my posts have been sorted by date. I need to tell Jekyll not to erase the pages I\'ve chosen not to rebuild (and it\'s too bad _config.yml doesn\'t understand wild cards)</p>\n<pre><code>keep_files: [archives/1999, archives/200, archives/2010, archives/2011, archives/2012, archives/2013, archives/2014 ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>At least "archives/200" covers an entire decade in one entry. :-)</p>\n<p>And that\'s it.

However, the Democrats have an organization for Democrats living abroad (called, appropriately enough, <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/">Democrats Abroad</a>) which is entitled to send delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Eight of those delegates are superdelegates, beholden to no one but themselves, but thirteen delegates are pledged.

This is one of the few chances that I know you'll be listening. At church the pastor talked about how Confirmation is a decision, an active decision, that you make. It is also an positive action... you are finding and <em>taking your place</em>.</p>\n<p>You are of course <em>taking your place in the church</em>. We were all just there, of course. The church is a human institution, of course, it is not perfect. But the humans in the church usually do the best they can. And the church has been around a couple of thousand years... if you have a question or a problem, chances are someone has come to the church with that before and it can give you advice.</p>\n<p>Confirmation is also a family event. They have all come to celebrate not so much because they are interested in your faith but because you are <em>taking your place in your family</em>. Confirmation has played a role in both our families, in Germany and in the US, and is something that binds them both. It is a family milestone, a sign of a new generation, and time and life moves on as it always has. Time only moves in one direction and at one speed. It always gets to its destination, even when we want to take detours.</p>\n<p>In rural Germany Confirmation is also a community event, much more so than in the US. It is the line you cross to become an adult. For your parents our town is a place we moved to, but for you it is where you grew up, your home, your <em>Heimat</em>. And now you will be <em>taking your place in your community</em>. You will no longer sing for candy on Pentecost, but plant trees with the young men. Later you can graduate from the youth fire dept to take responsibility for your community with the active fire dept. A hometown is something precious. A place where you can put down roots, find your peace, a place to belong. Your older relatives can tell what it is like to lose your hometown, your <em>Heimat</em>. It is something to be cherished in your heart.</p>\n<p>Finally, you are <em>taking your place in world</em>. Unlike in our town, in reality becoming an adult is not a solid line to be crossed. It's a process that you have now started, and maybe never ends, and process that you are now taking over for yourself. For your parents it means that we have taught you pretty much even thing we can, we cannot \"raise\" you anymore. We can't tell you anything anymore, as you remind us when we try to say something you disagree with. We have to start letting go, to stop setting rules and instead give advice and let you make your own mistakes. We are very happy and very proud for what you are and what you will become. I am certain that you have the qualities for success, in every sense of the word. Your self-confidence, your sense of fairness, your intelligence and stubbornness... a positive stubbornness, I should point out. It's OK to dream big, that's the only way big dreams can come true, just have a flight plan filed, just in case. As pilots say, flying is the second most exciting thing in life.

After over a decade of blogging on WordPress (I actually started using its predecessor <a href="http://cafelog.com/">B2</a> in 2002), I\'m now on the static site generator jekyll. My posts have been exported to text files. No more mysql database, no PHP, no more web interface. </p>\n<p>So everything is new and things are still broken. I don\'t have all posts imported yet, I\'m only back to 2012 and not 1999 when this thing started. There are a lot a worthless one-line posts from the olden days, since back then we didn\'t have Twitter and Facebook yet for worthless posts. So I have some work to do. But I\'m looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>The design, however, is absolutely fabulous, even on mobile, and for that I can take absolutely no credit. It\'s the <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">lanyon</a> theme for jekyll by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>, who co-wrote (Twitter) <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and I thank him for making his work available to us mere mortals. </p>'},{fields:{title:"Confirmation",date:"20 Apr 2015",slug:"/2015-04-20-confirmation/",tags:"Y2015"},html:'<p><a href="http://policke1.p2-men.de/"><img src="/assets/policke-200415.jpg" alt="Policke">{: class="alignright"}</a>\nLast week we bought a confirmation suit. Of course we went to <a href="http://policke1.p2-men.de/">Policke</a> in Hamburg. It\'s the perfect place for young (or older) men to shop. It has the feel of a 1920s haberdasher, full of dark little rooms connected by narrow halls and staircases. You\'re met at the front door by the head sizer, who determines your size with a glance and with a slight movement of his eyes directs you to the room where your size is stocked. Once there, you nod at the salesman (they\'re all men), who from your nod determines the style and price range you want. You\'re in and out in 10 minutes. No words are necessary at any time. </p>\n<p>Well, maybe not quite. :-) </p>\n<p>The confirmation will be at the end of May, on Pentecost Sunday. My mother will be flying in from the US. My father won\'t be there, of course.  He made a huge impression on his grandson, though, despite living an ocean and thousands of miles away. He thought of his grandfather when he chose his confirmation verse*. We also legally added his grandfather\'s name as an additional middle name for him. He will carry his grandfather\'s name the rest of his life, and he will be confirmed with it next month.</p>\n<p>So I guess my father will be there after all.</p>\n<p>*Matthew 7:7 "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."</p>'},{fields:{title:"How I Punked Facebook",date:"10 Feb 2015",slug:"/2015-02-10-how-i-punked-facebook/",tags:"Y2015"},html:'<p>It took me nearly two years, but I finally did it.

We never got in the habit of using Skype; a cordless phone is just a lot handier than turning on the PC. For a while I had a US Skype Number with a Minnesota area code. However, at ‚Ç¨5 a month it\'s not that cheap, and worse, my parents were not able to reach the number from their cell phones. And if I forward the calls to our regular German number, I pay Skype rates for the privilege.</p>\n<p>So I did some hunting around, and discovered the VOIP provider <a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/default.asp">Anveo</a> offers US numbers pay-as-you-go for $2 a month (<a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/mainphonenumbers.asp">"Personal Unlimited"</a> plan). You can then forward the calls to a regular number at their normal rates, but since we have VOIP at home anyway, I just set them up as an additional account and pay nothing. Calls to the US cost $0.01 per minute, slightly cheaper than our main provider. They have servers in both the US and Germany. We\'ve been with them for 2 months, and they seem to work just fine.</p>\n<p>In case you\'re wondering, our main VOIP (for home and home office) is on <a href="http://www.sipgate.de/team/voip">Sipgate Team</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004U6NTXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B004U6NTXU&linkCode=as2&tag=papascott-21">Gigaset C610 IP</a><img src="//ir-de.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=papascott-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B004U6NTXU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> base station.

The SIMs are pre-activated, you can add credit before your trip, and you can dial direct without going through a gateway to call Germany. Calls are $0.10/min in the US and $0.11/min to Germany. Network is ATT, and for the data plans <a href="http://goredpocket.com/plans#gsmt-mi">"tethering is encouraged"</a> (that was our mistake last year, no tethering, and we constantly fought over the one tablet with internet).

Or maybe "re-discover" is the better word, since for all we know we already knew all the things that annoy us about our partner but had conveniently forgotten them.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, salt. My mother is a health-conscious nurse, so even in the \'70s when I was growing up we didn\'t eat a lot of salt. She always cooked with a herbal mixture to replace salt. I never got in the habit of adding salt at the table, and don\'t think of a salt shaker as an essential piece of cutlery.</p>\n<p>My wife, on the other hand, will salt everything, often without tasting it first (especially if I have cooked it). She gets nervous if she sits at the table and there is not a salt shaker within reach. We sometimes have 3 or 4 salt shakers on the table at one time, since she often brings one to the table herself to make sure there\'s one there. And by my observation, her use of salt is moderate compared to some in her family and in Germany in general. I sometimes think that the heavy use of salt can so deaden the taste buds that one forgets food can have taste other than salt.</p>\n<p>So when my nutrition class mentioned that cutting down on salt was not only healthy, but good for weight loss, I had no problems putting that into effect for myself. It however opened up a new source of conflict. I would cook a healthy dish without salt, my wife would grimace and reach for the salt shaker, I would roll my eyes, and our entertainment was guaranteed for the rest of the meal.</p>\n<p><img src="/assets/gefro-040413.png" alt="Gefro Di√§twurze" class=\'alignright\' />Some peace has been restored to our household through the use of a salt substitute (which, strangely enough, is <a href="http://www.myline24.de/shop/essen-trinken/gefro-produktwelt/gefro-di%C3%A4tw%C3%BCrze-und-di%C3%A4tsuppe">sold</a> by the publisher of the nutrition class). It\'s based on potassium chloride, and tastes something like chicken soup. </p>\n<p>It doesn\'t work that well at the table, though.

It has been over 3 months since my last blog post.</p>\n<p>And about the time of that last blog post I noticed that my weight and fitness were both leaving much to be desired. (I\'m sure my wife noticed long before I did, and I\'m sure she tried to let me know about it, and I\'m even more sure I did my best to ignore her.) My weight was brushing up to triple-figures in kilograms (that\'s 220 pounds in dog years), and that was my wake-up call.</p>\n<p>For the past couple of months I\'ve been trying to put myself first as far as diet and exercise go. Instead of just thinking about going to the gym, I actually went to the gym three times a week. As motivation I bought a Spotify subscription for my cell phone and a set of <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/backbeat-go">Plantronics BackBeat Go</a> wireless sport headphones (as <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013489.html">recommended by vowe</a>‚Ä¶ with gadgets you can do much worse than to buy <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013739.html">what vowe keeps</a>).</p>\n<p>I also retook the <a href="http://www.myline24.de/">MyLine</a> nutrition course at our gym. Having taken it once before, it all sounded familiar and I was able to take more of it to heart than the first time. The first change they recommend is to eat 5 times a day. That\'s not as easy as it sounds. Avoiding alcohol is also a challenge. :-)</p>\n<p>But between the workouts and the nutrition and the positive motivation I was able to see results after two months. 6 kilos lost. Body fat reduced by nearly 3 percentage points. Waist and hips 3 cm smaller. Not bad for a guy who just turned 51.</p>\n<p>If you\'re doing the math, you\'ll know my weight is not yet ideal. (To help you calculate BMI, my height is 174 cm. As my trainer said, if I were 15 cm taller my weight would be ideal.)

It's said that it is more blessed to give than to receive. If that's the case, then I had a particularly blessed Christmas. I've been blessed by a ratio of approximately 10 to 1.</p>\n<p>A part of this is due to the arrangement that my in-laws have with one another, to not arrange gifts among the adults, but only for the nieces and nephews and then with a strict price limit. In this arrangement everything is systematic and pre-arranged without any risk of surprise or forethought. The suggested gifts are specified to the last detail, usually accompanied by a ISBN number or an Amazon link. Those who have no specific wishes simply wish for iTunes gift cards. Larger suggestions can be combined among families or with Oma, with a complicated accounting of how the costs are shared and who pays whom for what.</p>\n<p>As you may know, our gift for Christopher this was a somewhat expensive musical instrument, a set of small pipes imported from Canada. My idea was that the in-laws could give a share of the instrument as their gift to Christopher: the set budget for Christmas and birthday would cover one-twelfth of the cost. I assumed this would be entered into the post-Christmas cost-of-gift accounting. But for some reason, perhaps because the small pipes did not have an item number at Amazon, the in-laws had all instead prepared envelopes with cash for Christopher. That was somewhat awkward as he already had gotten the pipes on Christmas Eve, so I had to snatch the cash from the cards. One of them had even pasted the bills with double-sides sticky pads to the card, which could only be removed with 10 minutes elbow grease and nail polish.</p>\n<p>For my gifts within the family I did my best to break the rules about avoiding surprise and forethought. For Christopher I found a couple of his favorite US groceries (Honey-Nut Cheerios!), for my wife some Brazilian jewelry and her specific wish for a bag for eyeglasses on her running belt (she lost a pair in the woods a couple of months ago; if you see a wild boar wearing bifocals you know who they belong to). For both I found a print of a hand-drawn map of London to remember our recent trip.</p>\n<p>I'll admit I'm being selective about counting gifts received. I'm not counting cash from the US (saves on shipping and I can pick out what I want), and I'm also not counting the colored sugar-and-spice calendar given to both my wife and me. I will also admit that the 50-year-old male is not the easiest to pick out presents for. I probably wouldn't know what to get myself.</p>\n<p>In the end my best and only present is a blue terry-cloth bathrobe. I already had a blue terry-cloth bathrobe, but it was 10 years old and my wife decided it was too ragged to look at anymore. The new robe is longer but not as warm.

We lived in south Minneapolis, we could easily bike to the Metrodome, and the bleacher seats in center field cost just $3.

Her superior and many of her colleagues would move to Arizona too, and after a year of sticking it out with the new franchisee, we ended up moving to Arizona as well. We weren't able to find a place with her old boss in Arizona, but made the connections that brought us to Germany in 1990.</p>\n<p>So October 1987 was a turning point in our lives, and it just happened that the Twins won the World Series that month.

Both cars continued towards L√ºllau when the older driver motioned for the first driver to stop. Both drivers get out of their cars, and the 59-yr-old driver swung a punch at the 51-yr-old.

A couple days ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/papascott/status/204798796243283969" title="4 big changes coming to German McDonald\'s in the next 3 weeks! Never a dull day for us!">teased on Twitter</a> that big changes were coming to German McDonald\'s in the next couple of weeks. I was going to wait until the marketing started before going into detail, but now that the <a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/neuheiten-bei-der-fastfood-kette-bei-mcdonalds-perlt-es-bald-seite-all/6674690-all.html" title="Handelsblatt: Bei McDonald‚Äôs perlt es bald">Handelsblatt newspaper has spilled the beans</a>, it\'s OK to come out now.</p>\n<p>The big one comes on June 11, when McDonald\'s starts selling bubble tea in McCaf√©. Bubble tea is a trend drink that originated in Taiwan and is fairly new in Europe. It\'s basically sweet tea with fruit syrup and tapioca "boba" pearls or flavored jellies. The bobas or jellies sink to the bottom of the cup and can be sucked up through the straw. With 2 sizes, 3 types of tea, 7 flavors, and 6 flavors of bobas and jellies, there are over 250 combinations possible. Bubble tea is sweet and certainly not low-calorie, but generally contains less sugar than soft drinks. There will be a coupon in the the June coupon booklet if you want to give it a try.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bubble-Tea-50.jpg"  alt="Bubble Tea"  border="0"  width="266"  height="354" align="left" />Bubble tea is the fastest growing segment of the fast food industry and is very popular for 13 to 20 year olds. Bubble tea shops generally import their ingredients. The jellies and bobas for McCaf√© Bubble Tea are produced in Germany especially for McDonald\'s and contain no additives. Bubble tea is a first for McDonald\'s in Europe (maybe worldwide?), and if it is successful here we\'re sure other countries will follow.</p>\n<p>The second change is not so spectacular. Starting June 4 McDonald\'s will sell Br√∂tchen for breakfast, three types of normal German Br√∂tchen: Kaiser-, Korn and LaugenbroÃàtchen, either with traditional condiments (butter, jam, honey, Nutella) or as a sandwich. Br√∂tchen have been very successful for McDonald\'s Austria and we think they will be here, too. The marketing people call it "local relevance". We just think that if you want to sell breakfast in Germany, you have to sell what Germans eat for breakfast, so it\'s a change we welcome.</p>\n<p>The other changes are already out: a new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/mcdonalds-deutschland/id524943492">McDonald\'s Deutschland iPhone app</a> with in-app couponing (starting with the June booklet, not exactly cutting edge anymore but it\'s a start) and new lower price-point <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/mcdeal.html">"McDeal" menus</a> that cost 3-something instead of 5- or 6-something like the "McMen√ºs".</p>\n<p>That\'s a whole lot to learn and train the next three weeks, but hey, if we wanted jobs where each day is just like the day before, we\'d be in a different business. :-)</p>'},{fields:{title:"A Tale of Two Glasses",date:"16 May 2012",slug:"/2012-05-16-a-tale-of-two-glasses/",tags:"Y2012"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/twoglasses.jpg"  alt="Two Glasses"  border="0"  width="500"  height="145" /></p>\n<p>One of the joys of getting older is deteriorating eyesight. Having been near-sighted all my life, my near vision is now getting worse so that I\'m now in effect no-sighted.</p>\n<p>I have experienced the joy of bifocals for the past couple of years, and have learned to unconsciously tilt my head to the appropriate angle for looking things near and far. Things in the middle (i.e. somewhat beyond arm\'s length) are problematic, since they are in the transition zone of the lens and one can only focus on a thin horizontal stripe at one time. That makes it difficult to look at a larger surface, like, say, a computer screen, without constantly bobbing one\'s head to continually adjust the angle.</p>\n<p>But modern optometry has the solution: a separate set of computer glasses focused at the distance between your eyes and the monitor. Voil√†! I could see the entire screen at once for the first time in ages! However, every medical wonder has a dark side. Or multiple dark sides. The first is having to keep track of two pairs of glasses. Given that one can only wear one pair at a time on one\'s face, the other pair is always someplace else, and that someplace else is never the same place where one needs them. (I have an app to ping my iPhone when I\'ve misplaced it. There is no such app to ping my glasses.)</p>\n<p>Another new problem is that no matter which pair of glasses I have on, they always feel like the wrong pair. Even when they are the right pair. I was at least smart enough not to order identical frames for both glasses. The computer glasses have a ridge on the temples, so I can always feel with my fingers which pair I have on, because I can\'t tell just with my eyes.</p>\n<p>The third problem is that one has to remember to switch glasses when leaving the computer. (Switching glasses when coming to the computer is easy to remember, since the first thing one notices is "Oh, I cannot see the screen!") One cannot competently perform normal tasks when one can only see items exactly 20 inches from one\'s face. More than once I\'ve caught myself driving away from the house and realizing only then that I have the wrong glasses and cannot see past the windshield. Not good.</p>\n<p>So computer glasses are both a blessing and a curse, and have made my life infinitely more complicated than before.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Space Filler",date:"30 Apr 2012",slug:"/2012-04-30-space-filler/",tags:"Y2012"},html:'<p>This post is here only to put an A for April in the 2012 row of the archive list in the sidebar.

The Scottish bagpipe. And wear a kilt. At first we thought it was just a phase, and we laughed it off. And ignored it.</p>\n<p>But our son kept insisting. And looking up bagpipes on the internet. And kilts. So my wife and I decided to swallow our prejudices about bagpipes, and got him a \"starter kit\" for his birthday in December. It turns out to learn bagpipe you don't actually play a bagpipe for the first year or so, since it's rather complicated to keep the bag full of air and play music at the same time. You start out by learning the notes with a \"practice chanter\", which resembles the fingering part of the bagpipe and has a similar reed. It looks like a recorder, but takes a whole lot more air to play, and at first it sounds like a duck call.</p>\n<p>But after a few days with the chanter, the book, and the CD he started playing actual notes. And he kept at it. So we started to look around for someone to teach lessons. That's not quite as easy as with more common instruments, where you can sign up at the local music store. You have to do some looking around. At <a href=\"http://www.dudelsackkurse.de/\">http://www.dudelsackkurse.de/</a> we found Herbert Bartmann in Oldenburg who offers a day-long beginners course on weekends, and read that 12 is the perfect age to start learning. Oldenburg is an hour drive each way, somewhat impractical for weekly lessons, but I brought him in for the day course.</p>\n<p>We found that we were on the right track for getting started. Our son could play the scale and read notes by now, and after 8 hours with Mr. Bartmann was even more excited to learn more. He helped us make contact with a teacher in Hamburg, and we've had two lessons with him so far. It looks like our adventure will continue.</p>\n<p>As a lay person listening in on the lessons, I've found the bagpipe to be more interesting than I imagined, particularly how one works within the limitations of the instrument. Its range is limited (9 notes, a little more than an octave), has a constant volume (no way to play quietly), and has a constant, uninterrupted tone. All the music is in the fingering, with grace notes and doublings surrounding the individual notes.</p>\n<p>Our son's goal is to play a bagpipe solo at his school's Christmas concert‚Ä¶ this year would be a little soon, but 2013 is certainly an attainable goal. We'll see then if he's still serious about the kilt.</p>"},{fields:{title:"End of the Century - 50% Loaded",date:"09 Feb 2012",slug:"/2012-02-09-end-of-the-century-50-loaded/",tags:"Y2012"},html:'<p><object style="height: 390px; width: 640px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kJizV-d3sEQ?version=3&feature=player_detailpage"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kJizV-d3sEQ?version=3&feature=player_detailpage" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="480" height="360"></object></p>\n<p>Happy Birthday to me!</p>'},{fields:{title:"It's Still Raining",date:"13 Jan 2012",slug:"/2012-01-13-its-still-raining/",tags:"Y2012"},html:"<p>An inside joke in our house is that if I answer the phone and right after the \"Hello\" start discussing the weather, my wife knows my parents in Minnesota have called.

At last count we have four.</p>\n<p>We have two matching digital alarms from that German coffee and gadget (and sports clothing and kitchen utensils and and and) shop <a href=\"http://tchibo.de/\">Tchibo</a>. On mine the buttons are very difficult so it goes unused. My wife's is face down on the headboard. The clock is so bright that even at the lowest setting it casts the entire room in an eerie yellow glow. It's like one of those pods from Matrix.</p>\n<p>Number 3 is an iPod/iPhone speaker clock my wife gave me a couple of years ago. It somehow ended up on her side of the bed. It has way too many buttons and goes unused. Also, see above about iPhones being banned.</p>\n<p>Number 4 is an analog radio-controlled clock from precision clock-maker <a href=\"http://tchibo.de/\">Tchibo</a>. It glows in the dark and shows the precise time. However, being analog, the alarm is not at all precise and can be set only at circa 10 minute intervals.</p>\n<p>However, none of our collection of alarm clocks is particularly useful because from our bed we cannot see them. For one thing, our current bedroom furniture collection has no side tables but instead a headboard with wings, the surfaces of which are not visible from the pillows below. In addition, even if our eyes were equipped with periscope vision, we're both at the age that we cannot see much of anything without corrective lenses. For the purpose of telling time at night, any alarm clock for us is useless.</p>\n<p>So if we awake in the middle of the night and want to know the time, we need to reach for respective clock (for my wife, her face-down eerie yellow-glowing Matrix digital, for me my little round radio-controlled analog) and hold it close enough to our face for us to read it. By this time, we're awake enough that we couldn't go back to sleep anyway.</p>\n<p>I haven't yet even mentioned the most annoying alarm clock in the house‚Ä¶ a TALKING clock from that electronic super-store <a href=\"http://tchibo.de/\">Tchibo</a>. I bought it on a whim, but found the voice so EVIL that I immediately intended to throw it out‚Ä¶ but instead it ended up in our son's room. He sleeps in a high bed with no shelf for a clock, so he puts it in his bed against the sideboard. When he rolls over in the night, he rolls against the buttons and suddenly the clock starts speaking: \"THE TIME IS‚Ä¶ TWO‚Ä¶ FORTY-SEVEN!!!\" Our son sleeps through it, but the rest of us have to put up with random squawks of clock logic until one of us goes downstairs and extracts the talking clock from his bed.</p>\n<p>That we then know exactly what the time is in the night is no solace.</p>"}],Y2011:[{fields:{title:"Twelve",date:"27 Dec 2011",slug:"/2011-12-27-twelve/",tags:"Y2011"},html:"<p>John Gruber is wrong.

When we moved to Germany we shipped several boxes full of used paperbacks. These days with a Kindle, collecting novels is much easier. In case you're wondering, I've got Raymond Chandler complete ready to re-read, and lately re-read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Vintage-Crime-Black-Lizard-ebook/dp/B0036S4EVE/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321642259&amp;sr=1-3\">Blue City</a>, an early Ross MacDonald.

There's something about the combination of the extreme and banal, the murder and the police work, that a good author can use to make astute observations about society.</p>\n<p>Right now in Germany a real-life criminal case is giving ample opportunity for astute observations. A band of 3 neo-Nazis went underground 13 years ago and committed at least 14 bank robberies, 10 murders and 2 nailbombings. The facts have come out not through brilliant police work, but purely by chance. The last bank robbery 2 weeks ago was botched and 2 of the gang members shots themselves rather than be captured. The third tried to burn their apartment but turned herself in a couple of days later. You can read about it at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/18/how-german-neo-nazis-evaded-police\">Guardian</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/world/europe/neo-nazis-suspected-in-wave-of-crimes-in-germany.html\">NY Times</a>, or follow the sensationalist coverage at <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/topic/neo_nazi_terror_cell/\">Spiegel Online International</a>.</p>\n<p>This is particularly interesting because 1) the murders of foreign-born shopkeepers and the policewoman as well as the nailbombing in Cologne were high-profile crimes widely reported in the German media, and 2) German police and domestic intelligence have been particularly successful in infiltrating and stopping Islamist terror cells. Is German law enforcement blind to the right eye?</p>\n<p>I'll let others answer that. I wouldn't necessarily call a conspiracy what could be sufficiently explained by incompetence. Noone is more paranoid of Germans being latent Nazis than Germans themselves. But if you read <a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/\">Bruce Schneier</a>, you'll know he thinks security forces concentrate too much on acts that have already occurred. They couldn't imagine terrorists that don't take credit for their acts, so they didn't consider the possibility.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the result of all the political calls for action will be that right-wing violence in Germany will finally be taken somewhat seriously.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Frozen Fog",date:"13 Nov 2011",slug:"/2011-11-13-frozen-fog/",tags:"Y2011"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tree.jpg" alt="Tree" border="0" width="448" height="600" /></p>\n<p>I was impressed by the view from our back window this morning.

I told the salesman there I need a dark colored suit for a Christmas party, he picked two out that both fit perfectly and met Mama¬ís approval. I picked one, and we were out in 15 minutes, paying a least a third less than we would have downtown, and were home before the crowds arrived in the city.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This time the service was even quicker.

In short, we like it even more than we thought we would.</p>\n<p>You can't just go out an buy one, however. It's not available for general sale. We're participating in a cooperation between Daimler and McDonald's Deutschland that lets us participate in a test of using E-Smarts in corporate fleets. We lease and insure direct from Daimler, and I won't mention the price since I'm not sure it's representative of any market price. It's safe to say it's our most expensive company car. (Update: The <a href=\"http://www.smart.de/information-service-electric-drive-fragen-antworten/6bf159ed-0c58-5c54-855a-84b62adfdfaa\">E-Smart FAQ</a> at <a href=\"http://www.smart.de\">www.smart.de</a> mentions a leasing rate of 700¬Ä per month, plus VAT.)</p>\n<p>The basic statistics: it has a range of 120 km on a full charge and a top speed of 100 km/h. It takes 8 hours to charge a completely empty battery at a standard 220V outlet, or 90 minutes at a high-voltage charging station. The proponents of electric mobility say these limitations are not limitations at all, that 99% of daily driving can be done without having to charge away from home. We've found that to be true, and our battery has never gone below 50%. When planning your trips, though, you're always keeping those limitations in mind, and we make sure it's always charged up. It's also a two-seater, so family trips are out.</p>\n<p>We've found the E-Smart to be perfect for those short trips where gas and diesel are particularly inefficient. There's no warm-up time, the E-Smart is always ready to go. We live in the country, our grocery store is 3 km away, the school bus stop 4 km, Buchholz where we do most shopping 5 km. We can make those trips without feeling guilty at all.</p>\n<p>As for driving, it sounds and feels like riding an elevator or driving a bumper car. It has a one-speed transmission, so it never shifts gears, you just step on the accelerator and it goes. It will never win any drag races pulling from a stop light. It has air conditioning and a good (but not great) sound system that plays MP3s. And we can put the top down, though with this year's German non-summer we've done that exactly once.</p>\n<p>As for the operating costs, we've got a mini power-use counter on our outside outlet, so we know that we've driven about 2500 km on about 350 kWh. However, that does not count charges at the loading station in Rade (it's still in test and we aren't paying there yet). We pay about 23 cents per kWh for our eco-power at home, so that works out to about 3.25¬Ä per 100 km, which I figure is about half of what gas or diesel would cost. So it's not only fun and ecological, it's inexpensive too&#42;. (*Not considering the purchase price.)</p>\n<p>Are electric cars the wave of the future? I don't know. The car itself has no emissions, but power generating plant may be nuclear or coal, so you're just moving the pollution to where you can't see it. The high purchase prices make them uneconomical for most people right now. And I'm not sure how electric mobility fits in an energy policy that stresses conservation (particularly in Germany, which is giving up nuclear power). The future may be in hybrids, or a technology not involving a heavy battery. But it's worth trying out and thinking about, and our decorated E-Smart is turning heads.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Sanity Time",date:"18 Aug 2011",slug:"/2011-08-18-sanity-time/",tags:"Y2011"},html:'<p>Forgive me, readers, for I have sinned.

It\'s perhaps a sad fact of modern times, but we can\'t sell hamburgers without a working data connection... specifically, to program and maintain our POS system. The situation is complicated by the fact that magenta and red don\'t talk directly to one another and always blame each other for whatever problems occur. The current status is that we\'ll get super-slow 300 Kbit DSL this week, in the meantime they cobbled a connection first with UMTS (3G cellular) and then over the landline.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925448352" title="View \'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg\' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:right;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg" width="" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg" height="" /></a>POS System: As a result of the telecom woes, we didn\'t have a base POS system in place until 10 hours before opening with no time to test. The shaky data connection meant our help desk couldn\'t log in to us to fix the inevitable problems. The system crashed hard on close the first two nights. Our McCaf√© registers weren\'t properly connected to the system, and our Day 1 sales data for McCaf√© are gone. The operating system for the POS is brand new and pretty much undocumented. Our knowledge of the previous system is useless for the new system, so we were dependent on the help desk for setting things up for our requirements.

After the song the eldest recites a saying. Then the residents of the house treat the young men to a glass of schnaps or a sum of money.</p>\n<p>  Until Saturday,<br />\n  Your <em>Pfingsbaumfplanzer</em></p>\n<p>  <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/30/pentecost-singers/"><img alt="pent2004.jpg" src="http://papascott-de.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/05/pent2004.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" align="right" /></a> On Sunday, the boys and girls come in separate groups as the <em>Pfingstvoss</em>-Singers. They also sing songs and get in return a sum of money or candy.</p>\n<p>  These traditions are also documented in the L√ºllau Chronicle.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>We had schnaps and Mini-Dickmann candy ready for the men on Saturday, but they must have gotten behind schedule.

It was only for a week, we drove him to Amsterdam (5 hours each way) so he'd be able to fly non-stop and not sit in a strange airport by himself. Turned out he loved it, one week was way too short, and he'd fly by himself again anytime. His grandparents are willing to host him anytime (of course).</p>\n<p>Since we have <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/30/groundbreak/\">big plans</a> for the summer, we won't be able to take a family vacation, so we're thinking that maybe he can fly back to the States for a couple weeks before school starts, and so that his grandparents (my parents) won't forget what their son (me) looks like, I could fly in for a few days to pick him up. So I started looking at <a href=\"http://kayak.com/\">Kayak</a> for flight prices, and suffered a sudden attack of sticker shock. Four-figure sticker shock.</p>\n<p>Between high fuel prices, high season, and new German departure taxes, flights from Hamburg to Minneapolis in July and August start at over 1000¬Ä. Flights from any other German city are the same, and from Amsterdam is even more expensive. One exception was Icelandic, which has occasional flights from Hamburg this summer. They had a deal on some sites for 830¬Ä, if you will willing to handle an 8 hour layover in Keflavik (which is I guess why the Icelandic site itself doesn't list it, and is not appropriate for an unaccompanied minor).</p>\n<p>Trying to creative, I start looking at airports in neighboring countries, and see that flights from Copenhagen to Minneapolis start from the low 800¬Äs. Copenhagen is just 300km away, train there costs 30¬Ä, a commuter flight about 100¬Ä round trip. Could that work?</p>\n<p>The devil is in the details. The flights are in the morning or early afternoon. The cheap commuter flights are in the evening. The train takes 5 hours (there's a body of water in the way, so the train crosses the Fehmarn Belt by ferry), and with the airport connection would not make it in time for check-in. Taking an early commuter flight would eat up almost all the savings while making the trip more complicated (an extra stop with re-check-in).</p>\n<p>We might just have to bite the bullet and pay the four figures.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Groundbreak",date:"30 Apr 2011",slug:"/2011-04-30-groundbreak/",tags:"Y2011"},html:'<p>We\'ve been keeping a secret for the past several months, and it can now finally be revealed.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bautyp.jpg" alt="Bautyp" border="0" width="434" height="274" /></p>\n<p>We\'re pleased to announce that construction has begun for our 4th McDonald\'s restaurant!

And that a big problem in developing countries are the elite classes in those countries themselves, who either run the country corruptly or go abroad to study and never come back. And another big problem are agricultural subsidies in rich countries, which distort the entire world market for farm commodities and make it impossible for poor countries to feed themselves.</p>\n<p>It's all quite depressing, really.

Actually, they were in my legs and butt, and I was too dumb to realize they were really coming from my back. And I was too dumber <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/\">to go to a proper orthopedist</a> until 2 months later, who diagnosed a pinched nerve in my lower back, and it took another 2 months of shots and therapy to actually relieve the pain.</p>\n<p>At that time, as a kind of \"it can't do any harm and could do some good\" measure I signed up for a back therapy course at our local fitness center <a href=\"http://www.sportland-buchholz.de/\">Sportland in Buchholz</a>, with a group mostly 20+ years my senior. Part of the course was a back-strength check from <a href=\"http://www.dr-wolff.de/\">Dr. Wolff</a>, and my values were at first well in the red. Eight weeks later I had barely made it into the yellow area, so I had some work ahead of me.</p>\n<p>Of course I lapsed in my training, so exactly one year after my first episode I suffered a relapse of my back pain, which unfortunately coincided with two trans-Atlantic flights. Eight hours of sitting in a plane with a pinched nerve can only be a special level of hell never imagined by Dante.</p>\n<p>I mention all this now only because for the past year I've been more or less consistent with my training (mostly less), and just re-took the Dr. Wolff back-strength test. My strength values were all green. My triceps are somewhat weak, and my left side is stronger than my right, but the absolute values are OK. And I haven't felt any symptoms of back pain in nearly 3 years. Having gone through that hell, I'm happy not to have to deal with it again.</p>\n<p>My weight isn't yet optimal, and that plays a big factor as well. But it's gotten better. I weighed 106 kg when my back problems began, and I'm at 93 kg now. I'm still above my ideal BMI, but I'm much better than I was.</p>\n<p>Back pain is one of the major health problems in middle age. I've been able to beat it by reducing my weight and increasing my back strength. That strategy could work for others as well.</p>"},{fields:{title:"I Live Overseas...

Bush, and my own opinion on Iraq is ambivalent. I can¬ít think of a good reason to use force against Iraq, but then again, I can¬ít think of a good reason not to, either. The attack on Iraq is inevitable</p></blockquote>\n<p>My ambivalence back then was the hope that, despite my doubts that sending in troops can solve any problem, that deposing Saddam Hussein was a noble cause, that we were the good guys, that it was 1938 all over again and this time we would stop Hitler before he annexed the Sudetenland.</p>\n<p>In the process, however, we\'ve lost the moral high ground. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, waterboarding, "targeted killings" carried out by drones... and the war we started caused over 100,000 Iraqi deaths. It\'s not 1938, and if you have to impose democracy on a country then just maybe it\'s not democracy anymore.</p>\n<p>Before the war I was ambivalent.

One of them even took to giving commands as the poodle in the third person, as in "The poodle demands your attention", "The poodle is not amused", until finally, at the end of the evening, "The poodle has left the building".</p>\n<p>Alas, for me the honor would be counter-productive, as I would have to erect and statue of a mouse atop our restaurants, and as the move <a href="http://www.hamburgwiki.de/wiki/Laeiszhof">Ratatouille</a> shows, rodents and gastronomy do not mix.</p>'},{fields:{title:"The Poodle Is Watching",date:"15 Sep 2010",slug:"/2010-09-15-the-poodle-is-watching/",tags:"Y2010"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.hamburgwiki.de/wiki/Bild:Der_Pudel.jpg"><img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Der_Pudel.jpg" alt="Der_Pudel.jpg" border="0" width="449" height="599" /></a></p>\n<p>Sculpture atop the <a href="http://www.hamburgwiki.de/wiki/Laeiszhof">Laeiszhof in Hamburg</a>.

We\'ve already placed the seal prominently on <a href="http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/">our restaurant website</a>.</p>\n<p>The FaMi Seal is a new initiative in northeastern Lower Saxony by the DGB (German Federation of Trade Unions), the regional <em>Handelskammer</em> (Chambers of Commerce) and <em>Arbeitgeberverband</em> (employers\' federation), the local Federaton of Women and Business, and the Leuphana University L√ºneburg. In other words, the regional establishment for business, labor and education. The process involved the submission of an 8 page application documenting our efforts and an 1/2-day visit from the jury to show that we practice what we preach.</p>\n<p>What do we practice? As a nearly 24/7 business, we can coordinate the work schedules of our employees with their families. Employees with children are given priority in vacation planning. We have encouraged and enabled employees with children to move into management positions. We are willing to find individual solutions for problems that may arise. As proof that the process works, we have 4 couples (including our senior manager and his wife) working for us who are all able to coordinate their work schedules with one another and their families (which makes work schedules during school vacations interesting, but it can be done). Since January we have an office manager (who I supervise) who sets her own schedule around school and family.</p>\n<p>For us, although the public recognition is nice, this is all part of being (and not just talking about being) a good employer. It also gives us a competitive advantage in the job market, which is becoming tighter all the time as the German population ages. We see the seal not just as a reward, but as a commitment to become even better in the future. Our business will depend on it!</p>'},{fields:{title:"Anything But Sports",date:"10 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-10-anything-but-sports/",tags:"Y2010"},html:'<p>At first it wasn\'t easy following baseball from Europe. I followed the 1991 World Series (the one where the Twins beat the Braves and <a href="http://thesportsdaddy.com/?p=798">Kirby Puckett drove the bus</a>) by reading box scores on CompuServe and catching glances a day later at the international edition USA Today on the newsstand at the Wandsbek Markt U-Bahn station. That worked until we flew to Mallorca. I caught the scores of Games 6 and 7 on Voice of America via shortwave.</p>\n<p>These days it\'s a lot easier thanks to satellite technology, hard disk recorders and the internets. I can satisfy my baseball cravings as a casual Twins fan by following news feeds from the <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/headlines.jsp?c_id=min">official Twins site</a>, the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/">StarTribune baseball writers</a>, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/min">the Twins page at Yahoo!

For example, this week they are showing 12 baseball games live, including the Twins twice. Of course live in the US usually means wee hours of the morning here, so if you have a day job you need to record or wait for a rerun (with breaks cut out, so often better than live). The streams at <a href="http://mlb.tv">mlb.tv</a> are better yet. For a price they offer all Major League games either live or on demand, even on an iPhone if you so desire.</p>\n<p>Strangely enough, my favorite site for general sports news is the German <a href="http://www.allesaussersport.de/">allesaussersport</a> by Hamburg blogger Kai Pahl. He\'s a fan of anything and everything, but particularly NFL football. He also knows more about soccer than I ever will, so I get tips on figuring out the Bundesliga (try to say "Bruno Labbadia" and "master tactician" in the same sentence while keeping a straight face). I haven\'t been able to get into the community at <a href="http://www.allesaussersport.de/">aas</a>, though.

However, it just didn\'t sell well enough to fit into the production system. Either they were made to order, meaning you had to wait 6 minutes at a minimum, or the sandwiches were held well over the 10 minute holding limit, and you can imagine how that tasted (not good).</p>\n<p>In the meantime McDonald\'s here has implemented a made-to-order system (BOP in McJargon) for deep-fried products, so we can now better offer a fresh but low-selling product. And the market for vegetarian sandwich is still there and growing, particularly among young women, and vegetarians cannot live on salads and french fries alone.</p>\n<p>The new Veggieburger now headlines <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/12/marketing-non-secrets-3/">the relaunched SMS line</a>, along with the Cheeseburger and the Chickenburger. The deep-fried patty is based on potatoes, with carrots, red bell peppers, corn and onions, with a creamy sauce, lettuce and cheese. It\'s not a low-calorie sandwich. The calories per 100g (250) is the same as the Cheeseburger, but the Veggieburger is 20% heavier so has more total calories (360 vs. 300). It tastes alright, I think, although when I have 300 calories to spare on a snack I\'d personally take a Cheeseburger. :-)</p>\n<p>As businesspeople we\'re happy with how the product is starting out. Sales are in the neighborhood of the Hamburger, and it\'s attracting a target group that wouldn\'t be so inclined to visit us. The price of 1.10¬Ä means we\'ve broken the 1¬Ä barrier, and we can see how the guests react.</p>\n<p>There are no TV spots yet for the Veggieburger, but it\'s pictured briefly in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGzdP41MKrw">this cute spot</a> for SMS.

His passion is LEGO and all things related to science. He also goes inline skating and has just joined the local youth volunteer fire department. When he\'s in the mood, he helps out in the restaurants as cashier back-up or drive-thru runner. In the house we\'re currently renoving the basment into a proper office and guest room. No travel plans yet for 2010, other than a meeting in Orlando in April. We might actually properly celebrate our belated silver wedding anniversary this summer. This summer also marks the 20th year that we\'ve been in Germany. Hard to believe in 1990 we wanted to stay 3, maybe 5 years.

The value menu segment (the German equivalent of the US <a href="http://cep.mcdonalds.com/dollar/">Dollar Menu</a>) has been renamed to <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/schnell_mal_sparen.html">"Schnell Mal Sparen"</a> (which is hard to translate, maybe "quickly save now"). The products and the prices are the same as before, and the new logo is very similar to the old one. I\'m sure that most customers haven\'t even noticed the difference.</p>\n<p>So what is the difference exactly? Other than that "SMS" is recognized by the world as a quick and easy form of communication? After all, the old name was very well recognized, why change?</p>\n<p>The old name had a fatal flaw. It included the number "one" (twice even), and implied that the prices of the value items would always and forever be exactly 1.00&euro;. The SMS name no longer promises a price, and is thus flexible to include items that do not cost exactly 1.00&euro;. If things go as planned, we\'ll be adding an item or two that cost a bit more than 1.00&euro; to the SMS menu in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Are we going to raise the price of the existing SMS items? No, that would be stupid in the middle of a worldwide economic crisis that\'s just now hitting Germany with full effect. But we\'re using the economic climate to rebrand the value menu now to have the flexibility to adjust the menu in the future. That\'s a luxury we have as a brand that is growing while the total QSR market (and thus our competitors) are shrinking. We\'ll be able to use SMS as a marketing vehicle for years to come, irregardless of increasing costs or inflation.</p>'},{fields:{title:"As The Wall Fell",date:"09 Nov 2009",slug:"/2009-11-09-as-the-wall-fell/",tags:"Y2009"},html:"<p>It's strange that as the one world event that directly changed our lives, I don't remember where I was when the Berlin Wall fell or even exactly how I heard about it.</p>\n<p>In November 1989 we were in Chandler, Arizona, over 5000 miles from Berlin. We had moved to Arizona in May, and we didn't yet have permanent jobs. At first we had both helped out managing a McDonald's restaurant in the desert, but we were sure our future would be in the Valley of the Sun. Frauke was at a restaurant in South Phoenix, I was working for a temp agency. We had picked a bad time to move to Arizona, though. The Savings and Loan crisis had broken out, and the economy was flat.</p>\n<p>Arizona is 8 hours behind Germany, so evening in Berlin was early afternoon for us. We hadn't been following the events in East Germany that closely... we knew about the Monday Demonstrations, the refugees escaping through Hungary and Czechoslovakia and that there had been a large demonstration in East Berlin, but had no idea how close the regime was to collapse. Frauke got a call to turn on CNN from her friend Gabi, who herself had escaped from Hungary. I vaguely remember hearing the news in my car... it had to have been on the radio, on NPR, since it was still the BCP age (Before Cell Phones). I don't remember watching on television or thinking that the world from now on would be different.</p>\n<p>What changed for us personally over the following weeks is that Germany became <i>interesting</i>. Germany and Europe would be changing for the better, and we could imagine spending a part of our future there, especially since the stalled economy in Arizona meant we weren't getting ahead where we were. It was in fact the franchisee in South Phoenix that suggested Frauke think about Germany, and he had the contacts within McDonald's get her application started. </p>\n<p>By summer it was clear that the door was open if we wanted to make the move, and that it was time to make a decision. We were following that year's World Cup in Italy, and jokingly said that if Germany would win, we would move. The final was on July 8, Germany did win, and 6 weeks later we had sold or given away most of our possessions, packed a half-container with the rest, drove to Minnesota to say good-bye to my parents, loaded up 4 suitcases and 3 cats on a plane, and were on our way to Hamburg (first to Kiel, where we had a temporary apartment). Germany was not yet unified; reunification and the first elections took place that fall.</p>\n<p>We ended up in Hamburg pretty much by chance. We figured we'd eventually end up in Berlin, but McDonald's didn't have an office there yet. They did have offices in Munich, Frankfurt, D&uuml;sseldorf and Hamburg, and applied to Hamburg as it was the closest to where Frauke grew up. It turned out we'd never leave.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Don't Be So Damned Sure!",date:"02 Nov 2009",slug:"/2009-11-02-dont-be-so-damned-sure/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p>The best lesson for surviving as an expat I learned my first quarter... in fact, my first weeks at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>That lesson came early in the "Introduction to Theater" course taught by the legendary Arthur Ballet. My best friend Beth from high school was going to major in Theater, and even though I planned to major in International Relations, I had to take some Liberal Arts classes, so we took the class together. It was one of the most popular courses on campus, even though Prof. Ballet\'s health was poor and we often saw his lectures on video tape rather than live and in person.</p>\n<p>As a history of theater, we started with ancient Greece, and one of Prof. Ballet\'s favorite plays was <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html">Oedipus The King"</a>, which he summed up in a single phrase: "Don\'t be so damned sure!" Don\'t ever assume that you\'re right, about anything! Anytime! Oedipus thought he was king of the world, but in fact he killed his father and married his mother. (In fact, even 30 years after I took the course, you can still find a Google result for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=%22don\'t+be+so+damned+sure%22+arthur+ballet&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Arthur Ballet "don\'t be so damned sure"</a>.)</p>\n<p>For an expat, this means you have to be ready for anything. Anything, and everything, can be different than what you expect. In fact, you have to question what you expect. A trivial example: do you want to bake <a href="http://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/detail.aspx?id=18476">chocolate chip cookies</a> in Germany? I\'m sorry, you won\'t find chocolate chips in the grocery stores here. Or baking soda. Or brown sugar. Or even vanilla extract.</p>\n<p>Even if baking is not your thing, the concept remains... you have to be ready for anything and eveything to be different. And after a while, you\'ll notice that most of the differences are superficial, and the most important things that humans have in common are the same.</p>\n<p>To venture back to theater, another question raised by Professor Ballet is one he never answered in his introductory class. He mentioned a line that was the most profound in the history of theater, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Malfi">"The Duchess of Malfi"</a>, as the Duchess is killed by her brother, he says &ldquo;Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young.&rdquo; One night, on our way home after heavy drinking, Beth and I had the answer... we looked at each other and knew we had the meaning that Prof. Ballet had hinted at. But the next morning, it was gone. And today, if we were to meet and one of us would start to say "Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle...", we would both remember we once had the answer, but it is now gone.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Marketing Non-Secrets 2",date:"22 Oct 2009",slug:"/2009-10-22-marketing-non-secrets-2/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p>Following up on my <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets/">marketing post from yesterday</a>, I can cover the next two points rather quickly, since they are both in the current TV campaign for "Los Wochos". You only need to watch one spot, and only pay attention to the last 5 seconds to get both points. In fact, the first point requires only a screenshot.</p>\n<p>Point FP is "Food Photography". The past year or so our spots have featured "exploding food", with action shots of the inside of a sandwich, fries flying into the package, and drinks slopping over the cup. The new trend, currently mentioned in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_photography">food photography entry at Wikipedia</a>, is a natural look. Instead of a perfect glossed burger, the photo is more realistic, an unevenly focussed close-up from above of an unperfectly dressed burger with crumbs and lettuce lying about. Frauke and I call it the "crooked burger" look, and it\'s already in the current TV spot, and more photos in this style may be coming to in-store POP this winter. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/fp.jpg" alt="fp.jpg" border="0" width="480" height="285" /></p>\n<p>Point SC is "Secondary Claim". The primary claim for McDonald\'s is of course "I\'m lovin\' it!", or in German, "Ich liebe es!" Last year we heard Global CMO <a href="http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/bios/mary_dillon.html">Mary Dillon</a> explain that the unspoken promise made by the McDonald\'s brand is <a href="http://www.mcdstyleguide.eu/register/select-section/&ldquo;simple-easy-enjoyment&rdquo;.aspx">"simple easy enjoyment"</a>. </p>\n<p><object width="500" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/frNEEFGhpak&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/frNEEFGhpak&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="315"></embed></object></p>\n<p>The current spot ends by vocalizing this promise: "Einfach geniessen" (or "simply enjoy"), and the phrase occurs in the radio spots as well. We were told to expect to hear (and see) more of "Einfach geniessen" as a unifying theme for the brand.</p>\n<p>That\'s all the points I can reveal for now... number 4 will have to wait until next month. </p>'},{fields:{title:"Marketing Non-Secrets",date:"21 Oct 2009",slug:"/2009-10-21-marketing-non-secrets/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p>Last week we were at the annual fall franchisee meeting in Tenerife, where we had to endure sunny skies and 30&deg;C while those at home had a week of clouds and rain. We don\'t choose where to go for these meetings, we just go where McDonald\'s tells us to go. </p>\n<p>One highlight of these meetings is the marketing presentation, where the marketing department tells us how they intend to spend our money for the following year. Coming from marketing people, the presentation is of course very well done. This year, however, the content was also impressive. There were a number of simple, clear points where our immediate reaction was to nod and say yes, that\'s a good idea. </p>\n<p>I\'m not talking about specific campaigns here. As to whether we will be doing a Monopoly game, a World Cup promotion in June, or a Coke Glass giveaway next summer, you can probably guess the answers yourself. And for you Web 2.0 aficionados, I must disappoint you. There was no mention of social media at all. </p>\n<p>I know some of my readers have a professional interest in marketing, so without giving away any secrets, I can mention the points that impressed us as they are implemented and made public. (To jog my memory in the coming months, my list of points is H, FP, SC, S, V, PP, S4, and TC.)</p>\n<p>Point H is "Happy" (or "Mr. Happy"), the new European <a href="http://www.happymeal.de/">Happy Meal campaign</a> featuring animated Happy Meal boxes that started here in September.

I've been waiting for <a href=\"http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/\">someone more intelligent than I</a> to comment, but since she hasn't posted yet, I'll have to wing it.</p>\n<p>The best news is that the worst result was avoided, namely the continuation of the do-nothing grand coalition of Union and SPD with both parties shackled to one another. Whether or not one agrees with the direction, at least the new government will have a direction, which the grand coalition (by definition) did not.</p>\n<p>The new center-right coalition is also stable, in that it does not depend on so-called \"overhang\" seats (which have been declared unconstitutional, but only in 2011) nor on the whims of the junior partner (a weakened SPD might have been tempted to later dump the Union in favor the Greens and the Left party).</p>\n<p>Both main parties lost ground, but the SPD lost big time, with over 38% fewer votes than in 2005. The minor parties all had record results, in particular the ex-communist Left party was able to gain at the expense of the SPD. The SPD will now have time to sort out its defeat and how to mend fences with the Left, if it doesn't want to see politics dominated by the Union for decades to come.</p>\n<p>As for us, we're not disappointed to see a more pro-business slant for the next few years, although I would have wished for some Green influence against nuclear power. Change comes slowly in Germany, so new directions come only barely and slightly, but better than no direction at all.</p>\n<p>It's also worth mentioning the Pirate Party, which on a platform of internet freedom and data privacy won 2% of the vote (falling well short of the 5% threshold to enter the Bundestag). I personally find the Pirate Party to be a waste of time and effort. The issues they raise are important, in fact too important to relegate to a splinter party. They should be lobbying today's politicians instead of starting a new party that may or (most likely) may not have influence in 5 years time.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Easy Morning for Free: The Coupon",date:"26 Sep 2009",slug:"/2009-09-26-easy-morning-for-free-the-coupon/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p>The coupon for <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/20/easy-morning-for-free-goes-nationwide/">tomorrow\'s free breakfast on election day</a> just went online today.

It's financed something like Social Security, with a percentage (currently 14.9%) of income  up to a certain limit (currently 3675¬Ä per month) split between employer and employee.  The system covers children and students through their parents, as well as the unemployed and pensioners. Insured patients do not see any bills, but fixed co-payments for prescriptions, office visits per quarter, dental, and optical. There is not a single insurer, but nearly 200 different \"sickness funds\" with similar coverage and rates. Lost wages due to sickness are covered (actually, the employer pays the first 6 weeks, the insurer thereafter).</p>\n<p>High-income employees and the self-employed can opt out of the public system and purchase private insurance. Private insurance might be cheaper than public insurance (since premiums don't rise with your income) or might not (children cost extra, premiums depend on your age). However the coverage is better and generally there is a set deductable rather than co-payments. And as an employee, the employer covers half the premium.</p>\n<p>As a free-lancer, I was able to opt out of the public system in my early 30s and lock in good rates. Through a loophole in the system (involving extended part-time work), I'm now permanently opted out, regardless of my salary. My monthly cost for medical and dental is &euro;135 with a &euro;500 yearly deductable. That covers virtually anything, including lost wages. Even expenses when visiting the US are covered.</p>\n<p>Our disadvantages as private patients? Women pay more (pregnancy risk). We have to pay for Christopher. And our premiums may go up with time (with increases in inflation and life expectancy). </p>\n<p>The German health system is not perfect. The systems in France and Switzerland might be better. There are fairness issues... private insurance compensate better than the public system, so doctors favor private patients. Administrative costs for the sickness funds are high, and there is fraud. Drug costs are high, doctors are poorly compensated, and there are too many hospital beds. The system undergoes constant tinkering... but the system, which dates to the 19th century, still works. </p>\n<p>(As an employer, the multitude of sickness funds, covering sick pay for the first 6 weeks, and keeping track of various classes of employees with and without insurance is a bureaucratic nightmare. But we outsource to a payroll accountant that deals with all that.)</p>\n<p>The biggest benefit of the health system is peace of mind. I simply do not have to worry financially about getting sick. I still may worry about pain and needles and hospital food, but I don't need to worry about paying the bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Updated 17 Aug 2009</strong> Added current rates to 2nd paragraph (14.9% of income up to 3675¬Ä per month).</p>"},{fields:{title:"T and A Politics",date:"12 Aug 2009",slug:"/2009-08-12-t-and-a-politics/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/t.jpg" alt="t.jpg" border="0" width="225" height="300" /> <img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/a.jpg" alt="a.jpg" border="0" width="225" height="325" /></p>\n<p>I\'m sorry, but when I saw these two posters yesterday, I knew they just were begging to be combined in a single post.

That was my first time there, excepting a trip when I was 20 and took a Greyhound bus for 2 days from Minneapolis. That\'s not an experience I care to remember or repeat. As first timers for a weekend, we hit the standard tourist spots... Times Square, Empire State Building, and (especially for Christopher) the <a href="http://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</a>.</p>\n<p>We were however lucky enough to get Crown Tickets for the Statue of Liberty. The Crown was just re-opened to visitors on July 4th, and we were there a week later on July 11th. We were able to order tickets online the first day they went on sale. We were lucky. Only 30 people are allowed in the crown each hour. Right now, Crown Tickets are sold out through October and no Saturdays are available until December 5. Crown access costs $3 in addition to normal admission and ferry fare.</p>\n<p>The hitch is that the crown is only accessible by staircase, with 354 steps. The staircase spirals and is a bit tight at the end. Children must be at least 4 feet tall and able to climb the stairs by themselves.</p>\n<p>The tickets can\'t be printed out online, you need to pick them up at the will call window. We were worried about long lines, so we arrived at noon, 2 hours ahead of our scheduled time. That was way too early... there was no line at will call, and the waiting time for reserve tickets was just 15 minutes (those without reserve tickets were waiting 90 minutes). We hung out for an hour in Battery Park, enjoying a microbrew from the <a href="http://mypicnick.com/">Picnick kiosk</a> while Christopher explored the musical sculptures.</p>\n<p>We then joined the horde for the ferries, which were much like the Hadag commuter ferries in Hamburg harbor except for the airport-style security screening. Once on Liberty Island, we separated from the horde to head to the info booth to show our official ID and pick up wrist bands and instructions for the crown. The instructions were basically "ask the rangers along the way where to go next". No bags or backpacks are allowed, so we had to lock those up. There\'s another security screening (this time with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_Machine">puffer machine</a>).</p>\n<p>We entered the monument and were told to go straight on up the stairs. I lost count at 200, but the climb was easier than I imagined. There were a couple of rangers posted along the way to offer encouragement, but suddenly, there we were. Two rangers were at the top, and together with them for several minutes were alone on top of the world.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3752458049" title="View \'CIMG1447\' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2594/3752458049_26719d2cfe.jpg" alt="CIMG1447" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>We could feel the statue swaying slightly in the wind, and could see the torch moving back and forth.

Christopher asked the rangers about going into the torch... they told him it\'s been closed since 1916, when German saboteurs blew up a weapons depot on the Jersey side, and the shock waves slightly tilted the torch arm.</p>\n<p>In short, if you can plan enough ahead to get the tickets, the climb to the crown is well worth it!</p>'},{fields:{title:"McDonald's Versus",date:"23 Jul 2009",slug:"/2009-07-23-mcdonalds-versus/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p>This starts out as an ordinary McDonald\'s spot, but there\'s a surprise at about 28 seconds.</p>\n<p><object width="400" height="320"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5614632&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5614632&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="320" /></object></p>\n<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5614632">McDonald\'s Versus</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1349603">Bruce Branit</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>(via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/virtually-delicious">kottke</a>)</p>'},{fields:{title:"Happy Fourth",date:"06 Jul 2009",slug:"/2009-07-06-happy-fourth/",tags:"Y2009"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3691970158" title="View \'040709\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2598/3691970158_61fb8eb1de.jpg" alt="040709" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>Happy 4th of July weekend from Starbuck, Minnesota!

His grades were pretty good, we thought. One of the quirks of German family life seems to be that kids are to share their grades or show their report cards to anyone who asks. I remember that my report cards were a private matter between me, my parents and the school.</p>\n<p>But even though it seems like he just started school yesterday, it's time to start thinking seriously about what comes next. Elementary school ends after grade 4; at grade 5 the three-tiered German school system kicks in, with the kids divided into higher, middle and lower levels.</p>\n<p>We have a number of misgivings about the school system, and while Christopher is doing fine right now, we're not sure he will be well-served by the school system as it now stands. Here are some of my feelings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have no experience with the 3-tiered system and don't understand the reasons for it. A big part of American schools is learning social competence, to be able to get along with all of your fellow citizens, and that seems to be missing when the kids are divided up so early. I've heard reports that social background (as opposed to talent or intelligence) plays a bigger role in students' success in Germany than elsewhere, so maybe the division has as much to do with class as with competence.</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is no local control of schools as in the US. Schools are a matter for the individual states (Bundesl&auml;nder), and any decision regarding schools has to go through the hierarchical bureaucracy, for us from county (Winsen) to the district (L&uuml;neburg) and to the state (Hannover).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This means that education is a state political issue. The CDU tends to prefer the traditional 3-tiered system, the SPD and Greens tend to prefer reforms. School policy, and the school system, will change when new parties take over. Any aspect of the present system may disappear when a new party takes over.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Politicians don't know anything about education, and will make policy changes to achieve their own goals rather than to improve education. For example, in Hamburg the CDU was for the traditional 3-tiered system while the Greens were for a comprehensive system. In their coalition, they compromised to start the 3 tiers at grade 7 instead of grade 5. Most states have now shortened the upper Gymnasium track from 9 to 8 years for cost reasons, but without any plan for adjusting the curriculum so that the same material is being taught in less time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Education seems to be chronically underfunded. Facilities seem to be run down, and (at least in our state) parents are required to pay for books and materials for the classrooms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our community does not have a secondary school of its own. So no matter what level we choose for Christopher, he will have to be bussed to another town. There is an active citizens' group to establish a school here, and while they're at it then a comprehensive school for all levels. They even have a Wordpress-based website at <a href=\"http://schulkonzept.wordpress.com/\">Jesteburger BildungsBlog</a>. They of course have to deal with 3 levels of bureacracy, and it's a slow process. We hope they are successful, but we doubt that anything can be achieved before our decision for Christopher is due.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We live in a rural community, so we don't have a lot of alternatives. There is a church-based school in Buchholz, and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education\">Waldorf</a> school about 15 km away. Going to Hamburg is out of the question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are very happy with our elementary school, but we don't hear any good things about the local Gymnasium. They seem to be inflexible educational factories... you'll do fine if you go along and fit the mold, if not you'll fall by the wayside.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I recently heard a report how elementary schools here are somewhat biased against boys, with the lack of male teachers as role models and the emphasis of creative language skills over math skills. I can't say whether that's true, but it seemed to fit Christopher's experience thus far.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What does all this mean for Christopher's education?

My solution to that used to be to keep an automatic list of blogs I actually read.</p>\n<p>At the time I had a <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/07/blogroll-timestamps-with-perl-and-bloglines/">bunch of scripts to do the dirty work</a> (don\'t bother looking for them, they seem to be gone from SourceForge) that would pull my readling list from Bloglines and output a list for my sidebar.</p>\n<p>That was 2004, this is now, and with Google Reader and WordPress you don\'t have to do any of the dirty work yourself. It\'s pretty easy these days to list a subset of the blogs you read (keeping your sexblogs secret, of course) on practically any weblog.  On WordPress there is even a widget that makes it easier.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Google Reader you can choose to <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-20ers.html">make one or more of your tags public</a>. Go to your settings page, then under "Folders and Tags" you can choose to "change sharing" for the tags you choose. You then get links for a number of ways to share the articles or blogs that have this tag. Under "add a blogroll to your site" you can get some javascript to copy and paste into your blog template to get a blogroll.</li>\n<li>\n<p>For those of us who use WordPress, copying and pasting is too much work.  There is a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-reader-blogroll-widget/">Google Reader Blogroll Widget</a> that does the dirty work for us. Once you\'ve made the folder public in Google Reader, just activate the the widget, copy in one of the links, and you\'re good to go. This in effect sets up the same javascript you could copy in by hand.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I generally don\'t like putting in external scripts on my site, otherwise your site ends up to be a <a href="http://lumma.de">widget hell</a> that takes ages to load and hangs if any of them happen to break. I\'ve had good experience with scripts from Google, though, and face it... if Google is broken, the entire internet is probably broken as well.</p>\n<p>So now I\'ve made my "expat" tag public, and anytime I give the tag to a new blog, it gets added to the list. And if for any reason I stop reading a blog, it disappears from the list as well.

Reading her blog reminded me of the one time I visited Hungary and that we haven't seen as much of Eastern Europe as we would like. This is not so much about what we saw as about how we got there, and almost didn't get back...</em></p>\n<p>One thing about becoming a settled expat is that you are not able to be see as much of your new country and continent as you might think. Yes, in Germany we get 6 weeks vacation per year, but most of that is used either to visit friends and family on the old continent or to show visitors from the old continent things you've already seen yourself. My parents saw more of Europe on a 3-week bus tour than I've seen in 18 years living here.</p>\n<p>Our only true European adventure was back in 1996. We had just signed<br />\nthe contract to buy a house, and figured (rightly, as it turned out)<br />\nthat our time and money would be severely strained for the next couple<br />\nof year. If we wanted to take a proper vacation, we had to do it now.<br />\nBut since we had just put most of our savings into the down payment,<br />\ncost was a major issue. So we decided to do a Eastern European camping<br />\ntrip.</p>\n<p>My wife had a business conference in Prague that June, and we used<br />\nthat as our jumping-off point. She had a decent company car, but<br />\nwasn't allowed to drive it the the \"New East\", so I drove to Prague in<br />\nmy Renault R5 (similar to a Volkswagen Golf, except French and less<br />\nreliable... in fact it died for good a year later). Loaded down with 2<br />\nbicycles and a hatch full of camping equipment, I pulled up to the<br />\nPrague Hilton and spirited my wife away. Still in her business<br />\nclothes, she was brought to our tent at a campground literally on the<br />\nwrong side of the tracks. The next few days we were then able to take<br />\na closer look at the sights that she'd had only seen from the tour<br />\nbus.</p>\n<p>Our next stop was Lake Balaton in Hungary, which wasn't quite what we<br />\nimagined (too shallow and muddy). \"I want to swim in the blue ocean on<br />\nmy birthday,\" said my wife, and pointed to Istria on the map, just a<br />\nhop, skip and a jump through Croatia away. The map was, however<br />\ndeceiving. What looked like 3 hours actually took 10. For one thing I<br />\nhad to wait over an hour at the border for a Croatian visa (lesson for<br />\nspontaneous travel decisions... check visa requirements). In addition,<br />\nthe road from the border to Zagreb wasn't exactly paved, and the<br />\nmotorway from Zagreb to the coast wasn't yet exactly complete, so we<br />\nspent hours snaking through the hills under half-finished bridges. But<br />\nwe arrived at a wonderful campground on the coast with hundreds of<br />\nspaces, but only 10% occupied since the war had only been over for a<br />\nyear.</p>\n<p>Now that we knew about the bad roads, we decided to return to Hungary<br />\nvia Slovenia and Austria for our last stop in Budapest. We found a<br />\nbeautiful campground on a wooded hill overlooking the city. It was<br />\ngreat in the morning to coast with our bikes down to the river. It was<br />\nnot so much fun evenings to trudge with our bikes uphill.</p>\n<p>All in all, bikes are a great way to explore a new city, and we'd<br />\ncertainly do it again, but without the R5 and without the tent. Last<br />\nyear we took a bike tour of Barcelona and loved it (except for the<br />\nroad up the mountain to the Citadel). Between the sights you have the<br />\nchance to see the city from street level and get a feel for its pulse.</p>\n<p>But even today I shudder to think... what if our R5 had broken down on<br />\nthat dirt road in Croatia.

When a cowpath adjoins a highway, traffic from the highway must yield to traffic from the right on the cowpath unless right-of-way is posted on the highway with a <em>Vorfahrtstra&szlig;e</em> sign. Ninety percent of T-intersections have such a sign.</p>\n<p>It\'s at the T-intersections that aren\'t posted where I have problems.

We weren't disappointed. The seats were tight on legroom, and there were charges for headsets and alcoholic beverages. Most annoying, however, was the check-in system, which separate our seats on 3 of the 6 legs, despite having reserved seats together. We weren't able to check-in online (because the Hamburg-Frankfurt leg was on a partner carrier), so we were at the mercy of the airport attendants. We were able to trade seats in the plane to sit together, but it's still a pain. Our colleagues in business class, however, were happy with their flight.</p>\n<p>In contrast, our experience changing planes in Charlotte was wonderful. Customs and immigration was quick and efficient, luggage transfer was easy, walking distances from gate to gate were short, and the airport was comfortable for waiting, even when our Orlando flight was delayed for 2 hours, with plenty of shops and bars to pass the time. The central throughway is outfitted with wooden rocking chairs, for a Southern front-porch feeling which we thought was cute.</p>\n<p>Coming back, we were slightly late coming into Frankfurt and had only 45 minutes connection times. We ran from Gate C to Gate A and just made it... our luggage, however, did not, and was delivered to our home by taxi that evening. But you need to plan at least an hour for any transfer at Frankfurt, or longer if changing terminals and not just gate areas.</p>\n<p>All in all, if flying to the States with a change of planes, we advise planning the change in a smaller airport like Charlotte, and avoiding huge hubs like LaGuardia or O'Hare.

In English we did away with the informal forms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou">"thee" and "thou"</a> ages ago, but in German one still has to sort out the formal "Sie" and the informal "Du".</p>\n<p>When we took over the restaurant we made the conscious decision to address all employees as "Du" and by first name and invite them to address us the same way. For one thing, we wanted to send a signal that we were going to be very involved in the restaurant and be very accessible to all employees. The staff were pretty much all "duzing" one another anyway, and we wanted to be included. Our own experience with "Du" at the workplace had been good... Frauke had always been on a first-name basis with her top-level subordinates, and I had been in the IT industry where "Du" is the norm. In addition, we didn\'t to play any favorites. In any workplace you start "duzing" a few employees, and you end up the appearance that some employees are more favored than others. Finally, we wanted to remove a barrier to communication... it\'s a lot shorter and quicker to say "Frauke" than "Frau Petersen-Hanson".</p>\n<p>I know from experience the switch can be somewhat unnerving. After working in a traditional German office environment (well, as traditional as working mostly with expats can be), I was floored to be addressed as Du by the CEO on my first day working at an IT firm. The novelty and cuteness wears off after a few days, though, and it becomes normal.</p>\n<p>Our results in the restaurant have been mostly positive. The new hires pick up on it right away, and the old hands after a time have gotten used to our first names, though some still use the Sie pronoun. That\'s OK... we\'re not playing IKEA and forcing everyone to say Du to one another. Interestingly, it\'s the foreign-born staff that has put up the most resistance. I guess after having learned Du and Sie in a new language, it\'s hard to shift gears.

She went on to Minnesota Court of Appeals, so it didn't seem to hurt her career.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our original marriage certificate is defaced. Frauke is named on the certificate as \"Frauke (NMN) Petersen\" (NMN = no middle name), which she took that as a grave insult, and blotted out the \"(NMN)\" with a quart of Liquid Paper.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our German ceremony in 1985 was church-only, which in Germany counts for nothing. If you're not at a <em>Standesamt</em>, it doesn't count.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we moved to Germany in 1990, our American marriage certificate was initially not accepted by the Germany authorities... not because of the suspicious white blotch in the middle of the bride's name, but because the certificate did not have a number. The office in Kiel sent it off to the central <em>Standesamt</em> in Berlin, and 6 weeks later it was accepted, but with a long explanatory remark in our German <em>Familienbuch</em> certificate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since we each kept our last names when we married in the States, which is not allowed in Germany, most people in Germany assumed we were not married when we were introduced with separate last names. (Frauke has since added a hyphenated \"-Hanson\" to her name, not for my sake, but for Christopher's).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point, after 24 years, I don't think either of us has any interest in refuting the assumption that in spite of any and all doubts, we are truly married. Particularly with Frauke's career and financial success, the fact that we've had a joint bank account all these years would make a disentanglement of our affairs complicated and (for her) expensive.</p>\n<p>Then again, our bank just sent out updated EC cards for our personal account... and my card came addressed to her.

If the green light comes on, the system is activated. If not, I have to double check all the doors and try again. OK, I think I got it. I go through the late shift, we come out at 5:15 am, and I do the star-chip-star thing. The green light blinks a few times and goes out.</p>\n<p>Is the alarm now active or not? I have no idea. I now wish I had been a little bit more attentive, for example whether the light was supposed to blink or stay on, and especially the part about deactivating the alarm. The phone number for the alarm company is in the store, I don't have it on me. If I go in and the alarm is active, lights and sirens go off and the police are on their way.

By now it's 6:15 am, the opening manager is going to be there in an hour anyway, and I decide to give up and go home to bed.</p>\n<p>This was not satisfactory for Frauke... she now has no idea whether the alarm system is still broken or whether her husband is just too dumb to use it. Or maybe noone told him that there is a status monitor in the office to check whether all the doors are locked. It turns out the door to the utility room (a separate room only accessible from outside) is unlocked. During the day it had been opened for, irony of ironies, the repairman from the alarm company.

Yahoo! chose to listen to their lawyers without even talking to their users (<a href="http://www.nicozorn.com/2007/06/18/flickr-dann-loesch-doch-deinen-account/">and they still aren\'t</a>). <a href="http://www.burningbird.net/">Shelley</a> always warned that with such services, when push comes to shove, the users will get the short end.

For one thing, even though German law can be construed to imply that a online photo service faces criminal liability for their content, but in practice it has never happened. For another, given their historical experience with fascism, Germans are extremely sensitive to anything that reeks of control or censorship.

However I do have a business partner with a good sense of taste and style and the communication skills to get those across, even to me.

Today the <a href="http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/print/berlin/652190.html"><em>Berliner Zeitung</em> wrote</a> that the Kurdish woman has been pressured by the Turkish police, and threatened with violence. I think not only the behavior of the Turkish authorities, but also that of Berlin\'s Interior Senator, to be a scandal. One can only suspect that because the police and the authorities are unable to handle a few wild Turkish-Lebanese families in <em>Neuk√∂lln</em> and <em>Rudow</em>, the so-called "bouncer mafia", that they are making an example of this young woman, making a scapegoat of someone who is integrated and cannot defend herself, deporting her to Turkey simply to quiet public opinion.</p>\n<p>  These actions from Hr. K√∂rting are not only reprehensible, but also violate the principles of his party, the SPD, and human rights... As a party member, I will formally request the expulsion of Hr. K√∂rting from the party. And when the young woman has not returned to Berlin by the end of May 2007, I will take my party book, which documents over 35 years of membership in the SPD, and publicly burn it (i.e. a video will be posted here) and I will urge my fellow party members to do the same.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>J√∂rg himself lives in <em>Neuk√∂lln</em>, so I\'m sure he knows what he\'s talking about.

They were asking me if there were perhaps some secret PHP setting they were missing to make things right. Not that I knew of.</p>\n<p>I would have thought that in this day and age using UTF-8 with PHP and MySQL would just work. To try this out for myself, I downloaded some simple tutorial code, set up databases and HTML with UTF-8, and started creating records with names like Sc√∂tt H√§ns√∂n and M√§cky M√∂√º√üe. And sure enough, I got junk.</p>\n<p>PHP and MySQL don't just work with UTF-8. In particular, the client connection from PHP to MySQL defaults to latin1. There don't seem to be any PHP settings to change this. On the MySQL side there are 'default-character-set' settings you can put in various sections of the my.cnf, but for me they didn't seem to help.</p>\n<p>I found two ways to solve the problem. The first is to issue a <code>mysql_query(\"SET NAMES 'utf8')</code> immediately after every <code>mysql_connect</code> to manually switch the connection to utf8. That's a huge pain if you have a lot of code (even in my mini 5-file test-case I forgot one instance at first).</p>\n<p>The other is to add a <code>init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'</code> setting to the <code>[mysqld]</code> section of my.cnf. <code>init-connect</code> automatically executes SQL commands at the beginning of every client connection. The catch is the commands won't be executed for a user with SUPER privileges, so if you're lazy and using 'root' to connect to your database, it won't work.</p>\n<p>By using various combinations of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"blah\"/&gt;</code> in the HTML and <code>SET NAMES</code> for the database connection, you can create interesting errors. The '√É' errors seem to occur when correctly sent utf-8 is incorrectly saved over a latin1 connection, then read back out as utf-8. My friend said he was using <code>SET NAMES 'utf8'</code> with all his connects, I'm guessing he forgot it for INSERTs and UPDATEs. That's just a hunch.</p>\n<p>I wasn't able to find a clear explanation of this in Google (the closest was in the comments to <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-client-encoding.php\">mysql&#95;client&#95;encoding()</a> in the PHP documentation), so I thought write this up here.

Yesterday I finally got around to trying out <a href="http://www.pfsense.com/">pfSense</a>, which is based on M0n0wall but which can take advantage of bigger hardware. It\'s only been a day, but I think I\'m hooked.</p>\n<p>M0n0wall was developed for embedded devices, and can work with a minimum of CPU, memory and disk (or CF). That means that it doesn\'t have some features you might find handy in a firewall, like a login shell or a packet sniffer (<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~fredmol/m0n0/">they can be hacked in</a>, but still). M0n0wall does run on x86 hardware, but it\'s going to <a href="http://doc.m0n0.ch/handbook/faq-goals.html">remain focused on small hardware</a>. pfSense started as a friendly fork a couple of years ago to add features and a more recent FreeBSD for those with hardware to support them. We\'re not talking massive hardware here... <a href="http://www.pfsense.com/index.php?id=43">128MB RAM and CF</a> (as opposed to <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/hardware.php">64MB RAM and 8MB CF</a> for M0n0wall).</p>\n<p>pfSense released 1.0 last fall, but my M0n0walls at home and at work have been working well, so I never looked into it. We\'re now considering infrasructure changes at work, and it\'d be nice to have <a href="http://openvpn.org/">OpenVPN</a> on the firewall. pfSense has it. I run the CD-ROM version of M0n0wall on an old PC at home, with settings saved on a floppy. I inserted the pfSense CD and rebooted. It took over the M0n0wall settings and just worked. Over the console I was able to copy the running system to hard disk, so I can now add packages and install updates.</p>\n<p>Just clicking through the interface I found a half dozen reasons to consider switching even running systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSH login with standard command-line tools (mmmm, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump">tcpdump</a>)</li>\n<li>OpenVPN on board</li>\n<li>Aliases for groups of hosts, networks and ports</li>\n<li>Add-in packages for <a href="http://insecure.org/nmap/">nmap</a> and <a href="http://www.ntop.org/">ntop</a></li>\n<li>NAT reflector (NAT addresses available from LAN, makes routing <em>much</em> simpler)</li>\n<li>Load Balancer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aliases should be real nice since I was raised on the object model in <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">CheckPoint</a>.

The parties go through great lengths to avoid choosing their leadership and candidates openly and democratically, as in the current CSU contest between Huber and Seehofer where the CSU wants to avoid an open vote at all costs.</p>\n<p>The question is not whether one could imagine the possible chancellor candidates Merkel and Beck starting such websites, but whether one could have imagined (for example) the potential candidates Merkel and Stoiber starting such communities to win the CDU/CSU candidacy. Of course not. Since the electorate played no role in the decision, such a community would have been a total waste of time and resources.</p>\n<p>By the way, I hope <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/main/Nico">Nico is not serious about raising money for Obama</a>.

For example, their newest letter is \'H\', which is called "huh" (whisphered) and not "aitch" (or "haw" as it would be in German).

Most of the Europeans I meet seem to believe that huge numbers of Americans get no health care at all, while the rich few wallow in luxury.  In fact, the biggest problems uninsured Americans face are not doctors refusing to treat them, but the fact that they use the incredibly inconvenient emergency room for most of their care, and that a really bad illness could force them into bankruptcy....</p>\n<p>  Americans on the other hand, the overwhelming majority of whom are insured, seem to believe that millions of Europeans die each year from lack of treatment.  The reality is much less grim; a fair number of Europeans go without hip replacements and other quality of life treatments, and some do die on waiting lists, but many of those people would have died anyway, because they have nasty diseases with life expectancies measured in months.  America caters, expensively, to their desire to live a few extra weeks or months; Europe does not.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reality lies somewhere in between the extremes, as for most things. Germany seems to least avoid the worth of both worlds. Coverage is pretty universal, and waiting lists are rare. But health care reform has been discussed for decades.

The pain improved somewhat, so I didn\'t go to the orthopedist right away. But it didn\'t go away either. The pain in my left leg was less intense, but was more persistent. I skipped the pain pills some days, and they didn\'t seem to make much difference. Over Christmas it was clear to me that more help was needed, and I went to the orthopedist last Thursday, the same doctor who got MamaMaus up and running so quickly after her accident in July.</p>\n<p>He bent my legs a couple of times, took some x-rays, and was fairly certain I had a herniated disc. He put me on his standard 5-point program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <a href="http://www.painreliever.com/lumbotrain.html">lumbotrain bandage</a> to support my lower back</li>\n<li>buffered heels to be installed in my shoes</li>\n<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation">TENS</a> (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) pain treatment</li>\n<li>lumbar and cervical traction</li>\n<li>an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">MRI</a> (magnetic resonance imaging), with a possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography">ct</a>-guided periradicular injection (PRT)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/overview/lumbar/young/lum01.html"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/herniated_lumbar_disc.jpg" alt="Herniated Lumbar Disc" title="" align="left" /></a>The MRI and possible PRT were scheduled for today. I wasn\'t too keen on having a needle inserted in to my spine, and I approached the appointment with no small amount of anxiety and lost sleep. I haven\'t been in the hospital since having my tonsils removed at age 8. My most serious medical problem since then was a broken thumb.</p>\n<p>I went to a radiology clinic in Hamburg for the MRI. I spent 10 minutes in a tight tube with flashing lights and loud pounding (rather like a techno show), and within minutes the radiologist showed me a 3 mm extrusion from my L5-S1 vertebrae (very much like the picture <a href="http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/overview/lumbar/young/lum01.html">here (Fig. 2)</a>). We proceeded immediately to the PRT (my orthopedist is conveniently at the radiologist on Monday afternoons). My fear of the injection was totally unfounded. An initial scan to mark the point, an initial injection, an additional scan to confirm the position, and the injection was finished. I felt almost nothing, and the doctor said his aim was perfect. Within 20 minutes 90% of my pain was gone.</p>\n<p>My traction and TENS treatments begin tomorrow, and I\'ll have my shoes by the end of the week. It\'s vital that I lose weight, and I\'ll have to watch out for my back for the rest of my life. But for this evening I\'m looking forward to the best night\'s sleep I\'ve had in weeks.

This piece from <a href="http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/2006/12/yesterdays_new_york_times_spec.cfm">Free Exchange</a> is worth a long quote.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Until recently, only a small minority in most Western European nations received any post secondary education, even though tuition was low or free in most places.  Ironically, the ideal of free education forced the government to institute rationing through non-price mechanisms, in this case by limiting the number of spaces at university.  Wealthier children were more likely to get the high exam scores necessary to secure one of these scarce slots.</p>\n<p>  Recently, these countries have tried to make higher education more widely available. Unfortunately, they have tried to do so on the cheap.  This has put a tremendous strain on the resources of these universities, and as a result many talented professors have decamped to America. But the mere mention of instituting or increasing fees incites mass demonstrations of students, who believe the only fair education is free education.</p>\n<p>  However, fee paying education does not seem to discourage attendance. According the National Centre for Public Policy and Higher Education, 39% of Americans between the ages of 35 to 64 hold a college degree, just behind Canada. This figure is only 25% in the UK, 23% in Germany, 19% in France, and 10% in Italy. They are shrinking towards par in the current generation, but there is no sign that free education is making Europeans more likely to attend college.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Speaking from experience, as a student money for education is a solvable problem... loans, part-time jobs, scholarships, or even joining the military. There are ways around it. But there is no way around not getting a spot in the first place because universities are underfunded.</p>\n<p>The trend in Germany right now is to start charging modest fees to students without actually increasing budgets, the quality of education or the number of students. In other words, it\'s the worst of both worlds.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Could Those Be Angels?",date:"12 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-12-could-those-be-angels/",tags:"Y2006"},html:"<p>We've come to the conclusion that since the 4th Advent Sunday falls on Christmas Eve, Christmas is coming way too soon this year.

When it comes to anatomy, my German vocabulary fails me and I feel like I'm reduced to pointing and grunting. It has nothing to do with our family doctor himself. He's nice and friendly and knows me by name, which might have something to do with the fact that I'm privately insured.</p>\n<p>At any rate, he diagnosed \"Periarthritis humeroscapularis\" (which I think is Latin for shoulder pain) and prescribed ibuprofin and some toxic metamizol drops. If it wasn't better in a few days, I was to see a specialist for a cortisone shot (to get an immediate appointment, I was to utter the magic words \"privately insured\"). It did get better, but wasn't completely gone. The thought of a needle in my shoulder doesn't thrill me at all, so I haven't gone in for the shot yet.</p>\n<p>In the meantime it's November and a new stabbing pain appeared in my left leg. I first noticed it getting up in the morning, so I thought maybe it was a compensation for no longer sleeping on my shoulder. I didn't notice it at all when standing or walking, but it was there when sitting, and would shoot from my hip down the back of my leg when standing up, when stepping on the clutch when driving, or getting out of the car. It didn't get any better, instead after a couple weeks it seemed to be getting worse.</p>\n<p>The worst day was last Friday, when between taking the train to Hamburg, sitting at the children's theatre, going out to eat, then riding home I was on my butt for nearly 5 hours straight. I complained a little bit too loudly, and MamaMaus declared she would drag me to the emergency room first thing in the morning. \"But our family doctor has office hours on Saturday.\" \"No, he'd just give you pain pills and send you home.\"</p>\n<p>So on Saturday morning I was at the emergency room. I waited an hour for the intern, who diagnosed a pinched sciatic nerve (<em>Ischiasnerv</em>). He gave me some pain pills (Arthotec and tetrazepam, just enough for the weekend) and sent me home.</p>\n<p>The pills worked, but by Monday they were gone and I headed to my doctor to get a real prescription. But the doctor wasn't in. Monday was a national doctors' and pharmacists' strike to protest the proposed health care reform, and the practice was closed. With tears in my eyes, I searched for pharmacy that was open, and asked for something over-the-counter that was similar to Arthotec. That got me through to Tuesday, when my regular doctor was back in. He told me how evil Ulla Schmidt (German Health Minister, author of the health care reform) is and gave me a proper prescription. If it's not better in a few days, I'm to see a specialist.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I've done some reading on <a href=\"http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/d_sciatica/sc01.html\">sciatica</a>, so I know the problem is in my lower back, and that it's a fairly common problem for men between 30 and 50. It will probably go away in a few weeks, anti-inflammatory medication helps, but I'm going to have to pay close attention to my back from now on. I'll have to set up a proper workspace here at home (the MacBook on the kitchen table is handy for watching Christopher, but is murder for the back), take frequent breaks and take plenty of walks.

I\'ve never had much success with AdSense, my revenue barely covered the cost of maintaining the weblog (since our employers cover our phone and DSL costs, and my web hoster is prepaid, the running cost of PapaScott is close to zero). I\'m not going to make any radical changes to PapaScott (like, say, writing interesting content) just to increase ad revenue. I did run my URL one time through <a href="http://www.adsblacklist.com/">AdsBlackList</a> to filter out low-paying ads, and that seemed to work as advertised. My revenue doubled... from barely $10 a month to barely $20. Nothing to get too excited about.</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago I signed up for <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/">Text Link Ads (TLA)</a>. They sell static links (which can co-exist with AdSense) and pay out 50% of the revenue. You need to be able to add some code to your blog template, so it won\'t work for a lot of hosters (like BlogSpot). I was shocked to see that they priced my links at $125 each. I was even more shocked when the first two links sold almost immediately. As you can see in the sidebar under "Sponsored Links", I\'m currently at six, so you can figure out my revenue yourself. Let\'s just say it\'s time for me to consider the tax implications.</p>\n<p>I\'ve even had a couple of websites contact me asking if I would sell links or posts directly. No, I don\'t, the idea is that I don\'t want to do any work, that\'s why TLA can keep 50%. But if you want to buy a link, you can <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/packageDetail.php?packageID=44793">check out my listing</a> at TLA. I just opened two more slots, for a limited time only.</p>\n<p>Let\'s face it, the advertisers are buying the links so they can game Google. With PapaScott they get links from over 4000 pages dating back to 1999 with a <a href="http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html">PageRank</a> of 7 out of 10 (top 20 blogs like <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> might have a PR of 8, you can also <a href="http://www.prchecker.info/check_page_rank.php">check any site\'s page rank</a>). The links are valuable not because actual people see them, but because they get followed by search engines. My <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/http://www.papascott.de">Technorati rank</a> is about 63,000, which is impressive only if you believe there are really 55 million weblogs. There aren\'t.</p>\n<p>Does selling links dilute the value of search engines? Of course it does, but search engines are not a public good. They\'re big business, earning money from our content, and I have nothing against skimming a little off the top. I don\'t approve the ads myself, by the way, they just have to meet TLA\'s guidelines. No sex, drugs or casinos.</p>\n<p>It\'s interesting to see that when selling links, language matters.

That's been a failure, the University has started constructing a new outdoor stadium on campus. It's too bad they tore down the old one. I distinctly remember the last Gopher football game I saw at the Metrodome. Nebraska came to town, and held the Gophers scoreless. The Cornhuskers scored 3 touchdowns... in each and every quarter. That 84-0, for those who are math challenged.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, when Iowa comes to town it's different. In Minnesota we tend to think of Iowa as our less-cultured southern neighbor, and when 30000 Iowa football fans come to the big city with pigs on their heads and mud (or worse) on their shoes, it only reinforces the stereotype.

I took Friday off to accompany my lovely wife to a gala dinner in Munich. (Heidi Klum was supposed to be there, but she's still too pregnant.) We're in our 5-star hotel, we have to leave in 30 minutes, I'm changing into a tuxedo, literally standing in my underwear, when my cell phone rings. Our hoster is replacing the UPS that failed earlier in the week, something went wrong, and we lost power to half our rack in Hamburg. Again.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I'm beginning to thing that the 'uninterruptible' in 'uninterruptible power supply' is a cruel joke. I've had far more experience with losing power from a failed UPS or from poor handling of a UPS than actual power outages. The best story is from my old company, when the boss was demonstrating a UPS and cut power to all servers attached to it.</p>\n<p>In theory, the important machines have redundant power supplies and will keep running when one circuit goes down. In practice some things always fail (in this case a RAID that should have stayed up but didn't) and need personal attention to get back up and running, especially since we had had an outage earlier in the week and some services had been moved. In my underwear in Munich, though, I couldn't do much for the cluster in Hamburg. However, while we may have some single points of failure for the cluster, I am not one of them. My <a href=\"http://putzi.blogg.de/\">colleague</a> in Cologne only had to check a couple of small things with me, and had everything back up within an hour.</p>\n<p>Employees in Germany are legally entitled to vacation time, so nu2m can't get any ideas about preventing disasters by refusing all my requests for days off.

I own a iPod, two actually (a 4G 20GB and a 1G Shuffle), but they are more a source of frustration than of joy. I'm probably too old to get it.</p>\n<p>I find the iPod to be a beautiful and fascinating mistress that demands a lot of attention. For one thing, unlike a normal device you just can't turn it off. You have to hit two switches, the wheel to switch off, and the slide to lock it so it stays off. If you forget to lock it, it will bump against something in your pocket or your bag and turn back on, draining all the power.</p>\n<p>Even when it is turned off, the thing sucks power. I've found that if I don't listen to it for about a week, the power will be gone. Like I said, the iPod demands attention, daily attention, otherwise it goes into a sulk. More times than not when I want to listen to it, the battery is empty.</p>\n<p>By the way, I find the white earpods to be way too pretentious, again fitting of a attention-demanding mistress. I have mine hidden away and use Panasonic basic black.</p>\n<p>This whole syncing nonsense doesn't fit into the way I listen to music or use the computer. When I'm home, I listen to music over the air, not through my MacBook or earpods. The mp3 files are on a server in the basement, fed to the speakers with a <a href=\"http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html\">wireless Squeezebox</a>. I tried keeping a music folder on my notebook synced with the server, but it was a pain and now there's not enough room on the MacBook for a music folder anyway. When I'm away I want to listen to iPod (at least when it has power), so I basically never use iTunes to listen to music.</p>\n<p>Since I don't use iTunes to listen to music, it has no idea what I listen to and it's suggestions are useless. I've never bothered with playlists. My listening habits come from a time when music came on vinyl and you listened to a side at a time. At any rate, we have three listeners here at home, and I don't know how iTunes would sort my fine taste in music from that of my wife, and to ignore the stories that Christopher listens to. Needless to say, I haven't rated or tagged any files. That's just yet another demand for attention.</p>\n<p>I also find the random shuffle mode to be pretty much useless. When I listen to the Shuffle, I generally click forward to the song I want. It only takes about 50 clicks.</p>\n<p>Now I have a new problem. My music collection, or should I say our audio collection, is now 20.5GB. It no longer fits on the iPod. Since iTunes has no idea what I listen to, it has no idea what to sync and leaves all the new music out, which is pretty much the opposite of what I want. Since the iPod already demands too much of my attention in relation to the pleasure it brings, the last thing I want to do is to create a playlist for the iPod.</p>\n<p>I'll probably end up buying another one.</p>"},{fields:{title:"We Don't Need No Education",date:"08 Nov 2006",slug:"/2006-11-08-we-dont-need-no-education/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p>From an article on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/education/08germany.html">Jacobs University Bremen</a> (via <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2006/11/private_donatio.html">German Joys</a>), which recently changed its name after receiving a $250 million donations from a certain Herr Jacobs:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  German universities lack the resources of their American rivals.

So far so good.</p>\n<p>We weren't the only ones with this idea, so there was some traffic on the road. There was also some construction in Iddensen, where they are building a traffic circle to turn off to a garbage dump of all things. So we were later than we wanted to be by the time we reached the intersection with the A1 at Dibbersen <em>(Red Light)</em>.</p>\n<p>The traffic light had a long red phase. It wouldn't turn green.

I could hear MamaMaus cursing under her breath, and then somewhat louder. But I didn't suspect what would happen next.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she pulled off to the right and onto the onramp for the A1. If she couldn't drive through the red light, she was going to drive around it, I guess. At this point I didn't dare ask her what she was doing, since it would have made her mood worse, and it was too late to stop her anyway. So now we follow the blue line on the map.</p>\n<p>I guess she intended to drive to the next exit and turn around, but like I said it was jammed up. So we turn north on to the A261 back to Hamburg. It's clear in our direction, but southbound is jammed for several km leading to the A1. I'm now thinking she'll turn off at T√∂tensen and take back roads to Dibbersen to avoid the garbage dump and the broken red light. But she shoots on past, and when I ask why she says \"I'm not getting back on that road\". I then realized what she had in mind.</p>\n<p>She was going to circle on the Autobahn all the way around.... from Dibbersen to Marmstorf to Maschen and back to Dibbersen.

The southbound traffic was passing through, and I mentioned something like \"oh, the light has changed after all\".

Public broadcasting is currently financed by fees from TV and radio owners, ¬Ä17.03 a month per household or business (¬Ä5.52 for radio only). It's kind of like pledge week for US public television, except it's mandatory and there's no pledge week. There's a whole bureaucracy set up to collect the fees called the *Geb√ºhreneinzugszentrale der √∂ffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten*, or GEZ for short. They advertise quite a bit with spots that try to be hip, if you can imagine it could ever be hip to pay TV fees, since their main source of new income seems to be students who live away from home.</p>\n<p>Now that video and audio streams are available on the internet, so the logic goes, then \"internet-capable\" devices should also be subject to the broadcast fee, namely PCs and UMTS cell phones. Those that already pay GEZ fees would not pay any more, however any household or business with a computer would have to start paying in January. At the TV rate, that would be like an internet tax of over ¬Ä200 per year with absolutely zero benefit. As a compromise, the ARD is proposing to tax PCs at the radio rate. The ZDF might be against that, since the ZDF has no radio broadcasts.</p>\n<p>I have nothing against subsidizing broadcasting, even if it seems to be aimed more at senior citizens than the general population. Maybe by the time I'm a senior citizen, they'll broadcast punk concerts instead of *Volksmusik*. But the whole GEZ is an archaic concept. TV and radio are no longer luxury goods, but public goods, and the subsidy should be paid by everyone by taxes, not just viewers and listeners. Then the whole collection apparatus could be done away with, and there would be no need for an internet tax.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Moral Equivalence",date:"12 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-12-moral-equivalence/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p>I wasn\'t going to write anymore on 9/11 this year, my entry on Sunday pretty much summed up how I feel 5 years later.

I asked him today what he learned at school, and he replied "Nothing new". My mother says that sounds like me in the first grade.

I know those already." Patience, young Christopher, patience.</p>\n<p>We are of course concerned of how the class reacts to stuttering. We mentioned it briefly at the parents\' evening last week, and hopefully we can meet with his teacher in the next week or two to explain Christopher\'s stutter and the progress he\'s made. Meanwhile, a clinic recommended by his kindergarten offers a weekly stutter group for children aged 6 to 10 that will start later this month. Their main goal is to give the kids (and their parents) the feeling that they are not alone... there are other kids that stutter as well. That\'s more important at his age than working on specific speaking and breathing techniques, since his mouth is still growing and changing. The group is in Hamburg, so that will mean some driving every week. We\'ve also got to get a referral from his pediatrician so health insurance will cover the cost, so that\'s another appointment to be made this coming week. We also hope to arrange for him to get into a special PE (sport) group at school, since movement and exercise is also important for speech development. </p>\n<p>So Christopher may already be bored with school, but we\'ve still got plenty to arrange and organize.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Aliens at Roswell",date:"09 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-09-aliens-at-roswell/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p>They *are* among us. <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/060829roswell.htm">Immigration arrests 15 aliens in Roswell working for U.S. military contractor</a>.

We've just finished Chamber of Secrets (the 2nd book). He's very excited about it. Sometimes he puts on a tie and a cape and goes around with a magic wand putting spells on things and people. He's also drawn some elaborate scenes from the books in Kindergarten. </p>\n<p>So, is Harry Potter appropriate for a six-year-old?</p>\n<p>The teachers and child care professionals we've told about it have had no misgivings, but most of the parents we've mentioned it to have questioned our judgement. Most of the parents, though, hadn't read the books, but had seen scenes from the movies. </p>\n<p>Christopher has seen ads for the movies on TV, and that's how he knew about Harry Potter in the first place. The movies are inappropriate for his age, of course, but we let him watch the DVDs only with our supervision and only for the scenes we have already read in the books. He's adept with the remote control, and accepts our restriction. \"Do you know where we stopped reading? Do I have to rewind now?\"</p>\n<p>We also trust that he's beyond the age for confusing fantasy and reality. \"I'm just playing\", he says when he puts \"spells\" on us. \"There's no such thing as magic anymore.\"  He's been playing with Lego Bionicles for nearly a year, they also have a storyline of good versus evil. Good always wins, but evil never dies.</p>\n<p>Christopher comprehends an amazing amount from the books. We have to the chance when reading to make sure he understands. He always has questions, but almost always about what is about to happen next. \"We just have to keep reading.\" He doesn't understand everything, but the bit about Voldemort living without physical body is a tough concept for anyone.</p>\n<p>We find that Harry Potter is an ideal hero for a young stutterer about to start school. Harry is different from everyone else, he's misunderstood, and he's someone special. He cannot control how others react to him, he can only deal with it the best he can, and do what's best for himself.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Doc Test",date:"17 May 2006",slug:"/2006-05-17-doc-test/",tags:"Y2006"},html:"<p>I just got an Email with some blurb for a conference on IT security.

They just noticed that we built a carport that doesn't appear in their official plans, and could we please hire a surveyor to measure it (at our cost, of course), otherwise they would take the trouble to hire one for us (at our cost, of course). They didn't say which course of action would be more expensive. The funny part is that the carport has been up for over 8 years, so I guess they don't check their plans all that often. The other funny part is they sent us a photocopy of the survey of our street with all their notes, so we now know none of our neighbors bothered to hire a surveyor for their new buildings either.</p>\n<p>This will hopefully be the last unexpected cost of building our house (finished in December 1995).  That's the bad news when building here, there are tons of unexpected costs that noone tells you about or you don't think about beforehand, up to 20% of the total price if you start adding it all up. The good news is that after the first couple of shocks, you stop thinking about it and don't care anymore. While we were building we no longer talked about money, we talked about units, back then each unit was 1000 DM. Everytime something came up for which we hadn't budgeted, we just laughed,  counted how many units it would cost and added the bill to the pile. </p>\n<p>We didn't have any cash left because, as we learned immediately after signing the mortgage, the bank takes your money first. When you agree to put up 20% of the cost of building, financing 80%, the bank expects you to spend your 20% before they pay out a single penny. And the first bill comes right away when you sign the contract, namely the real estate transfer tax (<em>Grunderwerbsteuer</em>).</p>\n<p>Don't worry, spend money, be happy.

"So many things we worry about," she says, "are not important."

For another, we live in a fairly well-off suburban/rural county with more resources to devote to education than a typical city. And finally, Christopher was offered specific therapy for his speech problems, and in fact the state of Lower Saxony has made a priority of pre-school speech. Lisa\'s son suffers from dyslexia, and it sounds like Aachen has nothing specific to offer him other than the <em>Sonderschule</em>.</p>\n<p>But now our adventure with the German school system is about to begin.

Sport (namely soccer) in Germany is at best a 50-50 proposition. If HSV were to win the Bundesliga or even if Germany were to win the World Cup, at best 50% of the population would be happy about it, while the other 50% could care less or would even resent it. In the US sports is more 90-10. When your team wins, your entire community, or city or state, wins, any your sports heroes are heroes for everyone.</p>\n<p>Cities in America are pretty much alike. Minneapolis is pretty much like Des Moines is pretty much like Omaha is pretty much like Kansas City. Sport is one way we can differentiate ourselves from one another. People in Kansas City may be pretty much like us, but their team wears a different color. On the other hand, people in New York or Los Angeles are <em>nothing</em> like us, and it feels especially good on the rare occasions when we can beat the Yankees or the Lakers. Our sports teams don\'t just bring us together, they <em>are</em> us.</p>\n<p>And thanks to Kirby Puckett, we were champions, twice. He was the most popular person to ever live in Minnesota, period. He didn\'t look like an athlete (5&#x2032;8&#x2033; and built like a bowling ball; imagine <a href="http://www.schalke04.de/525_asamoah/asamoah.php">Gerhard Asamoah</a> with a few more pounds), but he was so talented, and publically so joyful, so likeable, so happy to be where he was, he wasn\'t just one of us, he <em>was</em> us.

Big deal, you might think. There are already established IM services with web-based clients, and there are already universal web-based clients like <a href="http://meebo.com/">meebo</a>. </p>\n<p>But mabber is a big deal. It\'s do-it-all-in-one-place and do-it-anywhere instant messaging. Most <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/006817.html">reviews</a> have concentrated on the web-client, but that\'s not where the magic is going to be. (Quite frankly, I find the web-client very distracting, and when working I use a <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">traditional client</a> to connect to mabber. That works, too.) The big deal is going to be the mobile client. Mabber is going to be quicker, easier, and more interactive than SMS. And cheaper, too, even after we start charging for mobile access and even if you are on pay-per-slurp data plan.</p>\n<p>And since it runs on the XMPP/Jabber protocol, it can use existing interfaces to ICQ, MSN, AIM and Yahoo!, and of course other Jabber services like <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I haven\'t tried the mobile client yet (it won\'t load on my Blackberry). So I don\'t know if anything I\'m saying about it is true. The key is going to be how easy it is. If it\'s a pain to install and contacts have to be added manually, it\'s not going to work. If it is truly easier to use than SMS, we\'ll have a killer app. </p>\n<p>In the tradition of Google mabber is an invitation-only beta, but we\'re pretty <a href="mailto:info@mabber.com">loose</a> with invitations. I\'m only peripherally involved with the project, since it runs out of our second (count them, two!) data center in D&uuml;sseldorf; my involvement is mainly \'keep everything else running so we can concentrate on mabber\'. Of course there\'s a <a href="http://blog.mabber.com/">mabber blog</a>. And the whole service is run in both German and English, our first project that goes beyond German-speaking countries.</p>\n<p>Oh, you can mabber me at shanson@mabber.com</p>\n<p><a name="interdings">*</a>Actually, mabber bears the imprint \'interdings GmbH\' rather than nu2m.

He'll crawl under the covers between us, crouch together for a few seconds, then suddenly spring up, taking the covers with him, and shouting \"Surprise!\" Typical kid stuff.

Out of the blue he said, \"When I grow, I won't stutter any more.\" It was the first time we heard him use the word stutter. </p>\n<p>The next day it got even better. Our \"homework\" assignment was to explain Christopher's stuttering and progress to a trusted adult. Christopher didn't need to participate in the conversation, but he needed to be present. The idea is to make him comfortable with discussing it openly, not to feel ashamed or embarrassed. </p>\n<p>We were in a restaurant with his old <em>Tagesmutter</em>, and we started explained how his words sometimes hop before they some out and what he has learned to do when that starts to happen. Then Christopher chimed right in and started describing the different techniques he has learned. There is rubber-band speech, tractor speech and race-car speech. There is frog speech (a syllable hops three times) and snake speech, each in slow and fast variations. He demonstrated them all, and make us repeat after him. It's now easy if you've never practiced, and he delighted in pointing out our mistakes.</p>\n<p>At our next appointment with the therapist we discovered how he had opened up. The two of them together had taken a large piece of paper and drawn a path of his progress the past 18 months, and his goal for this summer (which is to get thrown out the window on the last day... that's the tradition they have for the children that will be starting school). The path was full of twists and turns and had various triumphs and obstacles along the way. Christopher is very good at visualizing streets and maps, he can point out Australia and Florida on the globe. The point he seemed to pick up is that if you get stuck, it's OK to take a detour.

Last week was a further "exam" for the 2nd six months, as mandated by the state.

In practice it makes absolutely no sense to change kindergartens in mid-year, so we were really hoping for approval. We got it.</p>\n<p>We also got a written report on Christopher\'s progress. We already know how he\'s doing, of course, but it\'s nice to have something formal to show to school officials, since the registration process for first grade has already begun. Our goal is to have Christopher attend the local grade school rather than a separate speech program. Since he is coming from a special ed program, he\'ll be tested whether he is fit for first grade.

Here are the points that impressed me the most.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It runs on any Unix-like system or even Windows. The server is not tied to a particular operating system or Linux distribution. I was able to switch back and forth between FreeBSD and SuSE Linux servers with ease.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The connection can run on a single UDP port. It can been tunneled through a firewall with ease, and several clients can run behind a single firewall. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Software installation on the client is extremely simple. The configuration is a text file, but one only has to edit a couple of lines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authentication and encryption is done with standard OpenSSL certificates. If you can set up certificates for a web sever, you can set up certificates for OpenVPN. They even include a simple structure for setting up your own certificate authority (or you can use TinyCA or the native OpenSSL scripts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The networking is set up on the server side, and the routing information is pushed to the client. DHCP options like DNS and default domains can also be pushed to the client. Even for a site-to-site VPN, the configuration is all on the server side.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href="http://openvpn.net/howto.html">howto</a> was extremely helpful for setting up the server, and answered all the questions that I had.</p>\n<p>I\'ve been running an OpenVPN client (using the <a href="http://tunnelblick.net/" title="Tunnelblick - GUI for OpenVPN on the Mac">Tunnelblick</a>, a primitive GUI) for nearly a week now, and I\'m already convinced. I don\'t want to go back to using SSH-tunnels. For OS X, you\'ll probably want a <a href="http://njr.sabi.net/2005/08/04/overriding-dns-for-domains-in-os-x-tiger/">script to adjust your DNS</a> when connected, and you probably don\'t want to downgrade privileges to nobody. Linux worked well on the command line. I wasn\'t as impressed with the Windows client, but I don\'t use Windows much at all, so maybe I was missing something.</p>\n<p>It\'s not as simple as PPTP for clients, of course, since PPTP is built into Windows and OS X. But for users with more than basic needs, it\'s worth switching to OpenVPN. </p>'},{fields:{title:"Puzzled and Bemused",date:"07 Dec 2005",slug:"/2005-12-07-puzzled-and-bemused/",tags:"Y2005"},html:'<p>I was reminded of PapaScott\'s <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/05/">6th anniversary</a> (and indeed that of all early adopters of editthispage.com) not by <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/2005/12/06/6-year-blogiversary/">Susan\'s post</a>, but by a couple of <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/05/cats-in-sinks/#comment-2188" title="PapaScott &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Cats in Sinks">strange comments</a> that got past my spam filter.

I\'ve never really used them myself, being content with openssh-tunnels for my work. At my old company Netlife I inherited an IPSEC site-to-site VPN to a branch office, but I never had to touch it until we shut the office down. </p>\n<p>VPN was on my initial to-do list at nu2m, and I was happy to find the open-source firewall <a href="http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/">m0n0wall</a> with PPTP and IPSEC VPNs included onboard. We don\'t need VPN for our remote offices, as our provider organizes their DSL lines behind our firewall (using <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci1149279,00.html" title="virtual routing and forwarding - a Whatis.com definition - see also: VRF, VPN routing and forwarding">VRF</a>, virtual routing and forwarding). PPTP works fine for individual users, they just need a username and a password, and a client is included in both Windows and OS X. I can assign them IPs and control where they can go in m0n0wall. By default the clients direct all traffic to the internet through the VPN, which is fine for occasional users. Heavy user have to set up their own routes.</p>\n<p>PPTP on m0n0wall has its drawbacks, though. The Berlin office had a Windows VPN server of its own, and we were never able to connect to it after they were behind the firewall. M0n0 insisted on grabbing all PPTP traffic for itself. (The workaround was to set up logins for Berlin on our VPN server.)  And we were never able to run more than 1 PPTP client behind the firewall at one time, something do with the the magic of GRE packets. As for IPSEC, I was never able to get it to work. I could connect, but I couldn\'t reach any hosts beyond the firewall. I suspect that with 2 firewall hosts and the VRF, our network is like <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~vfischer/Shrekonionlayerspage.htm">Shrek\'s onion</a>. It has too many layers.</p>\n<p>We now have a partner that needs several clients to connect to our LAN simultaneously. PPTP doesn\'t cut it, because their firewall allows only 1 PPTP client at a time. So I\'m going to have to overcome my intimidation and come up with a way to slice the onion. I think I\'ve found the <a href="http://openvpn.net/">ginsu knife</a> to do it.

Yes, it\'s evil, but probably less evil than (like in the States) having your credit information available for anyone to buy. And there once you\'ve opened a checking account, obtained a telephone, applied for a driver\'s license, registered to vote and filed a tax return, anyone who wants to is going to have your address anyway...</p>\n<p>But I digress. Everyone here has to register their current address. But only German citizens get a plastic card that documents that, namely a <em>Personalausweis</em> or ID card. It\'s pretty handy, in fact you can travel throughout most of Europe with it instead of a passport, and it is accepted as identification for just about anything for which you need to identify yourself, and it\'s pretty much assumed that everyone has one. That favorite American ID card, the driver\'s license, won\'t work here since German DLs never expire and don\'t include an address. Strangely enough, the auto registration does include a current address, but no picture.</p>\n<p>But foreigners can\'t get a <em>Personalausweis</em>.

Our lifestyle just hasn't been keeping pace with our (or, more correctly, <em>her</em>) income. We can't manage to spend the money that comes in during a normal month, much less keep up with the bonuses and stock options that seem to regularly turn up. Our bank has been of some help, but it hasn't been enough. So this summer when yet another bonus arrived, we decided to enlist the services of <a href=\"http://www.fidelity.de/\">German branch of Fidelity Investments</a> for help.</p>\n<p>We had had an account with Fidelity several years ago. One very handy thing about it was that Fidelity accepted US checks without charging any fee. At the time we still had an American bank account to pay off our last American debts, and had had some bad experiences with wire transfers. One time a thousand dollar transfer to Minnesota was lost for over 6 months; it turned out it had gotten stuck in St. Louis and noone noticed. Our Fidelity account had been closed for awhile, since we had closed all unnecessary accounts in 1999 in preparation for Mama's year-long unpaid maternity leave, so we had to reapply for an account. So we filled out application and had our identities certified by the local post office (which took over half an hour, since we had a novice clerk and I had to explain where to find the necessary data in my foreign passport). </p>\n<p>A week later we received a letter rejecting our account. Fidelity Deutschland cannot do business with \"US persons\", namely me. In fact, they said they should have never opened the original accounts (which they still had on file). Back then they didn't use PostIdent, they just took our money. Sure enough, on the last page of the Terms and Conditions was a clause regarding not opening accounts for \"US Persons\". They suggested I open an account with Fidelity USA. However, to open an account with Fidelity USA you need an US address. So I guess expats can't do business with Fidelity, period.</p>\n<p>So in the end Mama opened an account in her name only. It's her money anyway. The funny thing is, now they had two applications on file for us, and they ended up opening 2 accounts, one for each of us, and each with an automatic monthly investment. That was going a bit too far in solving our financial problem, and we just this week got that straightened out.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Radical Trim",date:"03 Nov 2005",slug:"/2005-11-03-radical-trim/",tags:"Y2005"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/59423643/" title="Radical Trim"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/59423643_6a189d654c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0442" /></a></p>\n<p>We just trimmed our wild roses down to the ground and had several trees removed, and we\'ve discovered things in our backyard that we had forgotten we had.

It\'s very difficult to upgrade or do maintenance on an OBSFE, since when it breaks, everything breaks, and people tend to get upset when that happens. So my job the past few months has been to network, cluster, cajole developers to get their apps to work in a cluster, and delete all references to \'localhost\' from all configuration files. (In a cluster, localhost is not what you think it is, it\'s a black hole, so just forget it exists.) Late last week I was finally done. Nothing more was running on the OBSFE, all websites and databases were ported, and I was free to format and reinstall the OSBFE to become an upstanding member of our cluster.</p>\n<p>Except for one thing. The <a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/">jabberd</a> server. Our company depends on jabber for internal communication, and we had a jabberd on the OBSFE tied to an external IP address. Fine, I thought, just move the whole thing to a new server, put the address there, and it should work. It did, but only half way. Clients could connect, but servers could not and all transports (connections to AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo!, etc.) were broken as well. OK, back to the drawing board. I ended up setting up everything from scratch, taking a day and a half for a job I thought would take a couple of hours (and I\'m not done yet), and I came to hate the beast that is jabberd. Note that the following comments are completely subjective, and may have no basis in fact.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The jabberd server consists only of a jabber server, which is fine if you only want to talk to yourself and other jabber servers. The transports to other services are what make jabber really useful and interesting, and they are all separate little projects. Good luck finding current and working versions for them. And don\'t confuse <a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/">jabberd</a> with <a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/">jabberd2</a>. They are completely separate projects and have nothing to do with one another.</li>\n<li>The host setup is somewhat arcane. Jabberd works fine out of the box if you have a single box with a public IP open to everyone. Now most of us in the real world have firewalls and NAT to protect our servers, with private IPs on the servers themselves, and divide the services for a domain among several servers. Through trial and error I found a setup that worked (main hostname uses a private name, public hostnames set up as additional hosts).</li>\n<li>The latest jabberd is 1.4.4, which contains major changes to the previous 1.4.3.1. The <a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/doc/adminguide">published installation instructions</a> no longer apply, and all previous transports will not compile correctly. The workaround is to complile the transports against the old versions and copy the .so files into the new version. This information seems only to be available in the mailing list archive, but is essential especially for <a href="http://aim-transport.jabberstudio.org/">AIM and ICQ</a> to work.</li>\n<li>The MSN transport requires a curl library with SSL certificates. The SuSE curl packages don\'t include the certificates, so the transport fails with strange error messages. The are also 2 different packages you can use, a msn-transport (which we have) and a <a href="http://msn-transport.jabberstudio.org/">pymsn</a>. I couldn\'t find a homepage or any current information for msn-transport.</li>\n<li>The current <a href="http://yahoo-transport-2.jabberstudio.org/">Yahoo! transport</a> contains the wrong hostname to connect to Yahoo! You have to know this, search the mailing lists for the proper hostname, and correct the configuration by hand.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After a day and a half I\'m to the point where everything seems to work from the outside and with any domain I point to the server (without using any external IPs, yay!). Now I just have to get it working for the internal network. Then I can finally get rid of the monster OBSFE!</p>'},{fields:{title:"Dragon Hunters",date:"22 Oct 2005",slug:"/2005-10-22-dragon-hunters/",tags:"Y2005"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/54792170/" title="drachenjaeger"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/27/54792170_26fc68cd97.jpg" width="500" height="361" alt="drachenjaeger" /></a></p>'},{fields:{title:"This Is Not A Replica",date:"21 Oct 2005",slug:"/2005-10-21-this-is-not-a-replica/",tags:"Y2005"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/54599089/" title="World Cup"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/26/54599089_6fbdd4c54c.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="worldcup" /></a></p>\n<p>While Christopher and I were catching colds in Germany this week, Mama was in southern Italy, where she got to hold the World Cup.

We owned a townhouse, my wife had a good job, and I was in grad school. Then the Twins won the World Series, and everything changed. </p>\n<p>It had nothing to do with the Twins, of course. But as the playoffs started that fall, my wife\'s boss announced he was selling the business and moving to Arizona, taking his supervisor and several low-level employees with him. My wife\'s position would remain with the new owner, she was in effect sold with the company.</p>\n<p>About the same time, I realized that I didn\'t really want to be an economics professor when I grew up, dropped out of grad school, and started working in the real world.</p>\n<p>Things did not work out with my wife\'s new boss. All her friends were in Arizona, happy in the land of sun and fun. We were unhappy and jealous. Her old boss didn\'t have a job for her, but he would be expanding real soon and she could perhaps work a few months for an acquaintance of his until he was ready for her.</p>\n<p>However, our young urban townhouse was just a bit too urban. We were on the fringe of a drug neighborhood, and while police raids with bulldozers on crack houses are exciting to watch, they don\'t do much for property values. Having financed 95% of the purchase price, the townhouse was now worth much less than what we owed. We couldn\'t afford to sell, even more so with our student loan and credit card debt.</p>\n<p>So we wanted to leave, but we didn\'t have jobs and couldn\'t sell our house. So what did we do?</p>\n<p>We left, in May 1989. We left the house with my brother, packed 3 cats and everything we owned into a U-Haul, and drove to Wickenburg, Arizona, a desert nest on the road from Phoenix to Las Vegas where we could work for 6 months.</p>\n<p>The job with the old boss never materialized, we ended up losing the townhouse (we sent the bank the keys and let them foreclose), and we had arrived in Arizona just in time for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_Loan_crisis">Savings and Loan bust</a> and recession. So moving to Arizona was the dumbest thing we could have done, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong, it was the smartest. In Arizona we made the connection that brought us to Germany. In August 1990 we once again packed everything we owned, this time into a shipping container, and we and the 3 cats boarded a plane for Hamburg.</p>'

They jumped from the offices of Marsh & McLennan, the insurance company; from the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond-trading company; from Windows on the World, the restaurant on the 106th and 107th floors - the top. For more than an hour and a half, they streamed from the building, one after another, consecutively rather than en masse, as if each individual required the sight of another individual jumping before mustering the courage to jump himself or herself. One photograph, taken at a distance, shows people jumping in perfect sequence, like parachutists, forming an arc composed of three plummeting people, evenly spaced. Indeed, there were reports that some tried parachuting, before the force generated by their fall ripped the drapes, the tablecloths, the desperately gathered fabric, from their hands. They were all, obviously, very much alive on their way down, and their way down lasted an approximate count of ten seconds. They were all, obviously, not just killed when they landed but destroyed, in body though not, one prays, in soul.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I can read the entire article without breaking down.

New Orleans has no real competent government or civil infrastructure&mdash;and no aggressive media or organized citizens&rsquo; groups to prod public officials in the right direction during what will be, in the best-case scenario, a painstaking path to normalcy.</p>\n<p>The truth is that even on a normal day, New Orleans is a sad city. Sure, tourists think New Orleans is fun: you can drink and hop from strip club to strip club all night on Bourbon Street, and gamble all your money away at Harrah&rsquo;s.

I checked the account permissions, and they were all set up to automatically use local printers.

It was the end.</em></p>\n<p>Novelist Hans Erich Nossack was forty-two when the Allied bombardments of German cities began, and he watched the destruction of Hamburg--the city where he was born and where he would later die--from across its Elbe River. He heard the whistle of the bombs and the singing of shrapnel; he watched his neighbors flee; he wondered if his home--and his manuscripts--would survive the devastation. The End is his terse, remarkable memoir of the annihilation of the city, written only three months after the bombing. A searing firsthand account of one of the most notorious events of World War II, The End is also a meditation on war and hope, history and its devastation. And it is the rare book, as W. G. Sebald noted, that describes the Allied bombing campaign from the German perspective.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The original is entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3518015230">Der Untergang</a> published by Suhrkamp.</p>\n<p><a title="North Sea Diaries - A weblog of European politics" href="http://www.north-sea.net/archives/230">(Via North Sea Diaries)</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Blogroll Timestamps with Perl and Bloglines",date:"07 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-07-blogroll-timestamps-with-perl-and-bloglines/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was retrieving my <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/10/23/bloglines-timestamps/" title="PapaScott: Bloglines Timestamps">blogroll with timestamps from Bloglines</a> using their <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/services/api/">web services API</a>, but that both my scripts and their API were still buggy.

It was interesting to hear his main first impression of Germany: the "friendly" roads and drivers. The autobahns are certainly well built, and built for speed, but are German drivers really friendly? But then I remembered the t.A.T.u. album title "200 km/h in the Wrong Lane"... if that\'s a description of Russian driving, then German drivers must seem very friendly indeed. </p>\n<p>When I told him I came from Minnesota, he immediately thought of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/">Fargo</a>, and asked if Minnesotans really use wood chippers that way (if you\'ve never seen the movie, don\'t ask...). He also got the impression that Minnesota is colder than Moscow. Somehow I doubt that.</p>\n<p>Finally, he refuted one of my misconceptions about journalists. I had just maintained on the train ride to Cologne to Heiko and Gerd that the difference between journalists and bloggers is that blogger are can choose *not* to write, that they do not have a quota of minutes or column inches to fill. But Anton told me of a certain business dispute in Russia where both sides were paying him *not* to report the details, a form of reverse PR. He had no problems with that, since he wasn\'t intending to report on it anyway, but he was still disappointed when the dispute was settled.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Pirates of the Internet",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-pirates-of-the-internet/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>Since we didn't actually talk that much about press freedom at the discussion, I didn't get a chance to use the line I came up with.

And a government interested in controlling the press is going to be controlling the internet was well. The internet runs over wires and cables, and a poor country is not going to have that many cables coming in. And big IT companies like Sun, Cisco and IBM are going to be more than happy to sell the the equipment and know-how to control everything going in and out.</p>\n<p>That's no problem if you're going to be sending secret messages, you just use encryption and let the spooks spin their wheels. But weblogs are public messages, and once a weblog becomes bothersome, it's easy enough for a government to shut them down, or block them if they are hosted abroad.</p>\n<p>There are, however, a group of internet entrepreneurs that creatively and successfully work around such filters. If webloggers want to deliver a message to a place where the powers that be do not want that message to be heard, they have to start thinking like those entrepreneurs. </p>\n<p>That's right, webloggers have to start thinking like spammers, pornographers and file traders.

A discussion forum about blogging, organized for and by the mainstream media, <em>Das kann nicht gut gehen</em>, that could never work. However, it turned out that DW let the bloggers run the show, and so it was an excellent blogger meeting with some foreign guests. And an open bar. Sure, there were some DW types standing around with "look at those crazy kids" expressions, but they let us have our fun. There were maybe one or two journalists in attendance, so it was by and large a blogger event.</p>\n<p>What DW offers and what makes the BOBS awards more valuable that I had expected are its language resources. Bloggers talk a lot about creating international cross contacts, but we\'re not really sure how to overcome the language barrier. Delivering messages in several languages is something DW does every day. By bringing together a jury to evaluate weblogs in 7 languages, they let us overcome that language barrier, at least for a moment. They are able to bring Mu Zimei to us, even though she has never before left China and speaks only Chinese. </p>\n<p>The jury\'s decision will only be annonced in two weeks, but I\'m sure they have picked as Best Blog of the Moment some weblog from a far corner of the world that "we" have never heard of, in a language "we" cannot understand, and that tells a story that is for "us" completely new and exciting.

The problem was the slash at the end. </p>\n<p>I\'ve forgotten where, but somewhere I read that cool links end with a slash, since the URI is then a directory and it doesn\'t matter what filetype (if there is indeed a file at all) contains the page, the URI won\'t change. However, MT doesn\'t differentiate between the permalink and the filename that it saves. If you try to set MTEntryPermalink to a directory, MT tries to write to the directory instead of a file, which of course fails.</p>\n<p>One approach is to set MTEntryPermalink to blah-blah/index.html, and write a one-line <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html#plugins" title="add_global_filter(slashify=>sub{my $s=$_[0];$s=~s!index.[\\w]*$!!g;$s;});">global filter plugin</a> to delete the filename from every instance of MTEntryPermalink in all templates.

That\'s what I\'m doing now, but of course the problem with a patch is that it\'s a patch, and you have to remember to re-apply it when MT 4.0 or 3.2 or 3.112384 is released. But maybe the same thing can be accomplished with the new plugin architecture in MT3.

One afternoon we slipped over to the East by ourselves, and ended up on the patio of a high-rise hotel on Alexanderplatz, drinking beer in the sun at 60 DDR-Pf (about 10 US cents) per 0.5 liter and talking nonsense with some medical school dropout who wanted to somehow move west. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/opener.jpg" alt="opener" align="right" />This was our second or third day in East Berlin, and having exchanged for 25 East Marks each day, there was no way we could drink our way through our DDR currency. So we went shopping at the department store, and bought dishes. And a East German flag. And some beer openers, engraved with the price: EVP 0,15. I still have one. </p>\n<p>There\'s still a high-rise hotel, although they don\'t seem to have a patio with a beer garden. But there\'s a self-service kiosk with tables outside across the street, next to the world clock. Beer is now ¬Ä2.20, plus deposit. We stopped for a half an hour, wondered where the past 20 years had gone, and watched the world go by.

Since I\'m not using WordPress right now, I haven\'t really been maintaining it. A better alternative might be the <a href="http://epierce.blog.usf.edu/?p=15" title="Eric Pierce: WPexport 0.2">WPexport</a> plugin by Eric Pierce, since, unlike me, he regularly exports WordPress blogs (for students at the University of South Florida).</p>\n<p>To <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/15/Archive-Restore">paraphrase Sam Ruby</a>, a weblog software is only as good as its export function.

I humbly present Version 0.1 of an <a href="http://www.papascott.de/examples/export_wp.phps">export script for WordPress</a> for the Movable Type import format.</p>\n<p>A few caveats, apart from the usual it-works-for-me, your-mileage-may-vary and backup-your-data-first. </p>\n<p>1. It does not deal (yet) with entries with multiple categories. I don\'t use multiple categories, so I don\'t need this, but it could be done by adding yet another JOIN statement to the SQL and some fiddling with the output logic.<br />\n2. There are a few settings that I\'ve chosen not to read from WordPress, but instead to set explicitly in the script. If you look in the print_post function, you\'ll see<br />\n<code>echo ("STATUS: Publish&#47;n");<br />\necho ("ALLOW COMMENTS: 2&#47;n");<br />\necho ("CONVERT BREAKS: markdown&#47;n");<br />\necho ("ALLOW PINGS: 0&#47;n");</code><br />\n    I.e., all posts are published, all comments are closed, all pings are allowed, and all posts are filtered with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. You may want to change these or comment them out to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>3. The post slug from WordPress is copied into the key words field. To keep your existing URLs, you\'ll want to use a solution like <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/15/slugs">Mark Pilgrim\'s cruft-free URLs</a>. Note also that Movable Type uses underscores in their URLs; to have MT produce dashes automatically you\'ll need a plugin of some sort. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>3. When importing, make sure your character set matches whatever you were using with WordPress. Both WordPress and Movable Type now use UTF-8 by default, but if you\'re using something else, you\'ll want to adjust MT accordingly.</p>\n<p>3. I\'m also not yet dealing with extended entries, although that would also be easy enough to do. Everything gets thrown into the main post for now. </p>\n<p>4. <strike>If you search the WordPress forums, you\'ll notice that inquiries about exporting to Movable Type are met with abuse and derision. Be prepared for the same if you actually use this script to export your blog to Movable Type.</strike></p>\n<p>I\'ll be happy to update the script if anyone cares to correct any of these caveats (or anything else that I haven\'t thought of). For your abuse and derision, you can see the result of the export at <a href="http://mt.papascott.de/">http://mt.papascott.de/</a> (temporary URL, don\'t go linking to it or anything).</p>'},{fields:{title:"Christopher's Logbook",date:"31 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-31-christophers-logbook/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>Dear Family Hanson,</p>\n<p>Today Christopher and I drew a life-sized Christopher.

It doesn\'t do anything except register the plugin so I get a nice link to my CGI on the MT main page.</p>\n<pre>package MT::Plugin::Hello;\nuse strict;\nuse MT;\nuse MT::Plugin;\nuse vars qw($VERSION);\n$VERSION = \'0.1\';\nmy $about = {\n  name => \'MT-Hello\',\n  config_link => \'../mt-hello.cgi\',\n  description => \'Say hello to the world in a unique way.\',\n  doc_link => \'http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/12/hello-world-as-an-mtapp-cgi/\'\n}; \nMT->add_plugin(new MT::Plugin($about));</pre>\n<p>Next comes the CGI itself in <code>MT_DIR/mt-hello.cgi</code>, which does nothing but call my subclass of MT::App. Most plugin CGIs look exactly like this.</p>\n<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w\nuse strict;\nmy($MT_DIR);\nBEGIN {\n  if ($0 =~ m!(.*[/])!) {\n    $MT_DIR = $1;\n  } else {\n    $MT_DIR = \'./\';\n  }\n  unshift @INC, $MT_DIR . \'lib\';\n  unshift @INC, $MT_DIR . \'extlib\';\n}\neval {\n  require shanson::hello;\n  my $app = shanson::hello->new (\n    Config => $MT_DIR . \'mt.cfg\',\n    Directory => $MT_DIR\n  ) or die shanson::hello->errstr;\n  local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { $app->trace ($_[0]) };\n  $app->run;\n};\nif ($@) {\n  print "Content-Type: text/htmlnn";\n  print "An error occurred: $@";\n}</pre>\n<p>Now we get to the meat and potatoes in <code>MT_DIR/extlib/shanson/hello.pm</code>, where I say that all I really want my <code>$app</code> to do is print some text. I require a login only so I get a pretty header on the page. <strong>Update:</strong> I\'ve incorporated <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/12/hello-world-as-an-mtapp-cgi/#comment-1501">Phil Ringalda\'s suggestions</a>. The sub uri is so the pretty header links back to the proper mt.cgi instead of mt-hello.</p>\n<pre>package shanson::hello;\nuse strict;\nuse MT::App::CMS;\nuse vars qw(@ISA $VERSION);\n@ISA = qw(MT::App::CMS);\n$VERSION = \'0.1\';\nsub uri {\n  $_[0]->path . MT::ConfigMgr->instance->AdminScript;\n}\nsub init {\n  my $app = shift;\n  $app->SUPER::init (@_) or return;\n  $app->add_methods (hello => &hello);\n  $app->{default_mode} = \'hello\';\n  $app->{requires_login} = 1 ;\n  $app->{user_class} = \'MT::Author\';\n  $app->{is_admin} = 1;\n  $app;\n}\nsub hello {\n  my $app = shift;\n  my %param = (no_breadcrumbs => 1);\n  $app->build_page(\'hello.tmpl\', %param);\n}</pre>\n<p>Finally, I put a template file in <code>MT_DIR/tmpl/cms/hello.tmpl</code>, so my class knows what it is supposed to print.</p>\n<pre>&lt;tmpl_include NAME="header.tmpl"&gt;\nHello, world!\n&lt;tmpl_include NAME="footer.tmpl"&gt;</pre>\n<p>And no description of a web application is complete without a couple of screenshots:</p>\n<p>Main screen:<a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_main.gif"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_mainthumb.gif" alt="Main screen" border="0" /></a></p>\n<p>CGI screen:<a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_cgi.gif"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_cgithumb.gif" alt="CGI screen" border="0" /></a></p>\n<p>Now I just have to write a CGI that actually does something, like, ummm, what did I want to do again? Oh yes, set a couple of configuration variables for my plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 28 Oct 2004:</strong> David Jacobs noticed some missing backslashes, which I\'m guessing went missing when I reimported all my blog entries into Movable Type. Sorry about that!</p>\n<p><strong>18 Mar 2005</strong> MySQL ate my blackslashes again! Crucial backslashes were missing in <code>$app-&gt;add_methods (hello =&gt; &hello);</code> and <code>$app-&gt;build_page(\'hello.tmpl\', %param);</code>. Thanks to the ProNet mailing list for pointing this out in February and to Nathanial Irons for reminding me that I hadn\'t yet corrected this page.</p>'

There are, after all, a few million online banking customers in Germany. Probably because a password alone wouldn\'t get you very far. Ever since the days of 300 baud and Bildschirmtext, German banks have required both a PIN (general password) and a TAN (one-time transaction code) to conduct any business. It\'s inconvenient, and not 100% safe (nothing is), but better than relying on a password alone.</p>\n<p>The modern version of the TAN is the mobile TAN. Your register your cell phone number with the bank. When you make a transaction, the screen gives you a number to call within 90 seconds. You call in with your cell phone, the incoming number is recognized, and the transaction is approved. They are no less safe than normal TANs, and easier to use on the road.</p>\n<p>I mention the mobile TANs also because they are something my employer developed for the German Postbank. The project manager thought it would be cute to integrate mobile TANs into our bugtracker, the open source <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org">Mantis</a> (want a patch? get an mTAN!), so the past few days I\'ve been playing with a web service client under PHP.

Nonetheless, Shelley does have a good point. To be successful, WordPress has to provide support to users that is both effective and understandable. </p>\n<p>Bug trackers are a subject near and dear to my heart, since maintaining them is one of my main responsibilities at work (using <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/">Mantis</a>, the same software behind Mosquito). My bug trackers at work take a relatively closed approach. The customer communicates solely with a supporter, not directly with the developers. The support is able to solve most problems on his own. If he needs help, his communication with the developers in the tracker are flagged as "private", and are invisible to the customer. We thus use Mantis as both a support tool and a development tool, but the two functions are kept separate. </p>\n<p>The supporter is the main link in the process. He acts as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa">sherpa</a> between the customer and the developers, and decides whether the issue is a customer-side problem that he can help the customer solve, or a software problem that requires a developer (or a feature request that needs to be negotiated into the software spec).

Sherpas for open source are few and far between. But without them, an open-to-all bug tracker can disintegrate into chaos. Support for WordPress is probably best given in a forum rather than a bug tracker, with real people and plain language.

With WordPress, if you want to do anything slightly different from  what it intends (for example, customizing the text of the monthly archive links, or listing the 5 latest comments), you end up writing a hack, essentially rewriting one of its PHP functions to do what you want. But PHP is at least logical and well-documented. Movable Type has it's own well-documented but esoteric template language, for which you can find plugins to make it even more esoteric, with which you can do most but not all of what you want. I have about a dozen plugins installed, but I've forgotten which ones I really use. I can do Perl, I've done Perl for 10 years, but it's simple sysadmin baby-talk Perl, not elegant Perl like Ben and Mena. So I'm stumped by something simple like 'put all my post titles inline with the post content, except when an image comes at the beginning of the post content'.

As of 2003, child care costs are generally tax deductable, and since we pay our Tagesmutter 600 Euros per month, that\'s not a small amount added to our tax refund.

For a low or middle class family who actually needs the help, the subsidy is much less, which I don\'t think was exactly what Red/Green had in mind. Child care is subsidized for the rich, while the government kindergarten system, which is supposed to guarantee a place for all pre-school children, is underfunded and fails to provide places for 200,000 children. (The <a title="Kita-Reform :: Mehr Zeit f√ºr Kinder | Hamburger Initiative f√ºr mehr Kindergartenpl√§tze" href="http://www.kita-reform.de/">failed voucher system in Hamburg</a> is an extreme example.

It doesn\'t matter what goes in, what matters is what comes out. And for the three opposition parties in Germany, who together have a majority to determine the new German <em>Bundespresident</em> in May, the process of grinding out a   common candidate has been very messy indeed. That common candidate is the current head of the International Monetary Fund <a title="IMF Chairman Resigns (washingtonpost.com)" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30514-2004Mar4.html">Horst K√∂hler</a>.</p>\n<p>The office of <em>Bundespresident</em> is for the most part ceremonial and non-political, but the election every 5 years of the president by a convention of the federal Bundestag and the state parliments is highly political. This year has been more political than usual, with the rivarly between CDU and CSU, and the current weakness of the FDP. </p>\n<p>Germany has been lucky with its presidents. The first presidents I experienced, von Wiezsacker and Herzog, were eloquent spokesmen for Germany, its history, and its place in the world. Unfortunately, the SPD opted for an active poltician when it had its say in 1999. While Johannes Rau has been a good president, he has not lived up to his predecessors. He is unable to rise far enough above the poltical fray to exert moral authority, the only authority the office affords. </p>\n<p>The first choice of the Union parties, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, is also an active poltician, and would have had the same weaknesses as Rau. Therefore I am pleased that the selection has gone to a non-politician. I know little about K√∂hler, except that he served under Kohl, and has been a capable IMF director. Knowledge of global finance can certainly be an asset for a Germany searching for the proper role in the global economy and political order. And now the politcians who chose him can return to their daily business, producing sausage. What matters is what comes out.</p>\n<p>(Coincidentally, sausage-maker Kohl today presented the first volume of his <a title="Amazon.de: B√ºcher: Erinnerungen" href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3426272180/qid=1078437363/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/028-5204065-7104530">memoirs</a>.)</p>'},{fields:{title:"NY Times: Al Qaeda operatives were tracked by their anonymous GSM SIM cards",date:"04 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-04-ny-times-al-qaeda-operatives-were-tracked-by-their-anonymous-gsm-sim-cards/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="Authorities knew their numbers but not their names" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/04/international/europe/04PHON.html?ex=1393736400&en=71c64fa22f23d30a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">NY Times: Al Qaeda operatives were tracked by their anonymous GSM SIM cards</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Chinese Turnips",date:"04 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-04-chinese-turnips/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>A while ago I <a title="PapaScott: In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has." href="http://www.papascott.de/2004/01/13/2800.php">mentioned</a> Mark Twain\'s famous comment that "in German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has".

Our Notes admins have various log rotation and safety commands in their server scripts, so they very much prefer that the server be powered down correctly. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was wrong. The server started just fine on power up, calling the script on the command line worked just fine, but doing an actual shutdown seem to skip over the stop script completely.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nI'm now setting up a new Notes server, and took the chance to figure out what's going wrong before it goes online. After about 20 tries, I finally saw the light. We had copied the start/stop script from a Solaris machine. It simply called \"server start\", \"sever stop\", or \"server kill\". Linux (at least Mandrake and Red Hat), however, keep lock files for their services under /var/lock/subsys. When /etc/rc.d/rc is called for a change in run level, it does not run the stop script if the lockfile does not exist. Therefore, our stop script for Notes was never called.</p>\n<p>We never noticed this before since we don't have that many homemade services, and none of them ever complained when they were killed rather than shut down. And Linux servers don't need to be shut down that often. The problem doesn't seem to be that obvious; doing some Googling, I was unable to find any advice that rc scripts under Linux <em>must</em> use lock files in order to be called correctly.</p>\n<p>In our case of Notes, the use of lock files is inconvenient at best. Our Notes server processes run as user 'notes' rather than root, and our Notes admins log in as 'notes' to do server maintainance. However 'notes' is unable to write to the lock directory, so the lock directory may correctly reflect the status of the Notes processes. But for now, we're just happy that our Notes log files no longer get blown away by a system reboot.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Davids Medienkritik: German-American friendship in Huntsville, Alabama",date:"18 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-18-davids-medienkritik-german-american-friendship-in-huntsville-alabama/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="Tolerance where you might least expect it" href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/we_have_this_se.html">Davids Medienkritik: German-American friendship in Huntsville, Alabama</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"German Engineering",date:"17 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-17-german-engineering/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>The tech project from hell: the German transport ministry today announced the <a title="Expatica" href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=52&story_id=4751">cancellation of its contract with Toll Collect</a> to build a satellite-based toll and tracking system for trucks.

Applied to those with public health insurance (90% of all Germans), 10 Euros is to be paid for each doctor visited per quarter in cash at the time of the first visit. The fee is waived for children and for referrals. The idea is to discourage patients from going directly to specialists without a referral from their family physician. Although the fee is collected by physicians, it goes entirely to the insurance funds. The physicians bear the administrative costs and the risk for those patients they treat but who refuse to pay.</p>\n<p>But the devil is in the details. Germans in the public insurance system have never seen a bill for their health care... now they suddenly have to pay before they see a doctor. The fee also applies to emergency rooms and ambulances (unless you called the ambulance through 110), so emergency personnel need to carry cash boxes and issue receipts. (The fee also applies to those given care involuntarily... imagine trying to collect cash from a drunk being admitted to detox.) The fee applies to welfare recipients and pensioners. There is a cap of 2% of annual income (1% for the 'chronically ill', which the law doesn't really define) for all practice fees and co-payments... so make sure you save all your receipts.</p>\n<p>The fee was part of the bi-partisan health reform law of last year, so both major parties are to blame. Best of all, the members of Bundestag <a title=\"Praxisgeb√ºhren-Rabatt: Die Parlamentarier haben verstanden - Wirtschaft - SPIEGEL ONLINE\" href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,281184,00.html\">exempted themselves from the fee</a>, along with civil servents. Instead of 10 Euros per doctor per quarter, they pay a flat 20 Euros per year.</p>\n<p>My guess is the practice fee will quickly be repealed.</p>"},{fields:{title:"ARD Tagesschau: News in English",date:"07 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-07-ard-tagesschau-news-in-english/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="Actually, it\'s by Deutsche Welle" href="http://www.tagesschau.de/english/">ARD Tagesschau: News in English</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Otitis Media",date:"06 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-06-otitis-media/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>As the first consequence of our visit with the <a title="PapaScott : Speech Therapy" href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/12/23/2769.php">speech therapist</a> last month, we took Christopher to a ear-nose-throat specialist today.

So I just told magpie to treat a 'feed' as a channel and an 'entry' as an item.</li>\n<li>Magpie doesn't parse XML attributes at all. However, 'links' in Atom are defined purely as attributes, and each 'feed' or 'entry' can have several links, while in RSS a 'link' is simply a string. So I had Magpie create an array of items for each link.</li>\n<li>I then told FoF about the new elements in the array, for example to use the 'tagline' for the 'description' if it exists. I also wrote a function for FoF to select the first appropriate link if the link is an array instead of a string.</li>\n</ol>"},{fields:{title:'PapaScott 3rd site on Google for "earthquake in iran"',date:"03 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-03-papascott-3rd-site-on-google-for-earthquake-in-iran/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="Behind Red Cross and CNN, ahead of BBC and Pravda?

He confirmed that Christopher is way behind in his speech development for his age. This could be caused by a combination of environmental factors: being a (spoiled) only child, having two working parents, spending full days in day care, and having a non-native-speaking parent (which I can confirm; I simply have no idea how well a 4-year-old German child should speak, and I have no ear for subtle mistakes).</p>\n<p>Of course we should check for physical causes as well. His 4-year checkup is beginning of next month, and we should tell the pediatrician about our concerns. He hasn't been sick the last year at all, but he had a couple of ear infections when he was younger, and he probably inherited my susceptibility to ear, nose and throat infections. I think I remember seeing a speech therapist as a child (but I'm not sure... Grandma?). If my memory is not invented, I remember it as something I did <em>not</em> enjoy.</p>\n<p>We'll probably start week appointments at the end of January. My shortened hours at work will make it easier to plan. Meanwhile, we (espcially Mama, maybe Oma) are to read with (not to) him as much as she can, and let him explain the stories in his own words. I was right to stop speaking English with him for now. We do not need to be concerned about stuttering at this point, as it is normal at this age for children to think more quickly than they can speak. But at 4 he should be able to speak clearly and in complete sentences.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Christmas Baking",date:"23 Dec 2003",slug:"/2003-12-23-christmas-baking/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><img alt="crhcookies.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/12/crhcookies.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" /></p>\n<p>is easy with ready-made cookie dough from the supermarket.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Tree",date:"21 Dec 2003",slug:"/2003-12-21-tree/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><img alt="xmastree2003.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/12/xmastree2003.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" /></p>\n<p>Three guesses what we did today (actually, what Mama and Christopher did...

The answer is more complicated than just yes or no (although this quick answer is I don't speak English with Christopher as much as I should).</p>\n<p>In theory, my wife would speak German with Christopher and I would speak English. In practice, I find it difficult to consistently speak English with him. Unlike most of the Anglo-German couples we know, we speak German rather than English at home. Actually, we agreed to speak the language of whatever country we're in, so when we're in the States we speak (mostly) English, and when we are in France or Italy... then we are in trouble. Anyway, while this was good for my German, it means I am totally out of the habit of speaking English around the house. I have to remember to make the effort, and Christopher answers in German anyway.</p>\n<p>Most bilingual kids we know are like that. They understand the English-speaking parent perfectly, but will answer in German. Only when visiting with relatives that speak no German at all are they willing to speak English. Only later (around 10 or 12) are they willing to speak the second language on their own. The exception is when the parent pretends not to understand German at all... and I'm not willing to do that.</p>\n<p>We're also a bit reluctant to push English on Christopher right now, since we're concerned about his speech skills in general. He speaks somewhat unclearly, and our day care provider has recommended a speech therapist. Our initial appointment is this month.</p>\n<p>This is a <a title=\"Kids-Club e.V. Bendestorf\" href=\"http://www.kids-club-ev.de/\">local organization</a> that offers English classes for kids as young as 3. We even took Christopher to a couple of classes, but he wasn't ready to be left alone and it wasn't worth my taking 3 hours off work to drive him to a 45 minute class where he didn't want to be.

And like everyone else, I\'m finding I spend a lot more time on my notebook, even at home, than at my desktop. I\'ll  be buying it myself, so price is a major issue. 1200 Euros is my target, 1500 the absolute maximum I can pay.</p>\n<p>I wanted to choose an iBook, I really did. The new 12" G4 is 1199 Euros, right on target. It has Unix pre-installed. It has geek credibility. And it looks cool. But 1199 Euros is not the end. I\'d have to add an Airport card, since it can\'t take my old PCMCIA wireless card. And 256 MB RAM is a bit weak, would need to be upgraded. And I\'d have to buy software, Net News Wire and BBEdit just for starters. And I would have to learn a new operating system, with its own <a title="macosxhints - Repair permissions to resolve slow system issues" href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030526181056549">quirks</a> and <a title="Apple Mac OS X 10.3.1 - MacUpdate" href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/13052">bugs</a>, and be beholden to Apple, a company I neither like nor trust.

It uses standard client programs like rsync and tar or can read Windows smb shares, so there is nothing to install on the clients. It has a nice web interface (mod perl) for administering full and incremental backups and for retrieving restored files (either save to client or retrieve as tar or zip archive via http), Best of all, it has a intelligent pool system so that identical files from various clients are stored only once. So if you have several dozen identical workstations, your disk space requirement for the backup is the size of a single workstation, or less if you turn on compression.</p>\n<p>We want to use it for something different, which is why it's taken me so long to get it going. We want to take nightly backups of our development servers, specifically the working directories of our developers with their CVS playgrounds. The servers are under load literally both day (development) and night (daily builds). A typical partition is 20 GB with 1.5 million files, with lots of duplicates . Our tape drives are maxxed out, so we'd like to put the daily backups on disk and archive to tape just once a week.</p>\n<p>My problem was not setting up BackupPC itself, but setting up the clients. My test machines all had good performance, but under real conditions rsync was simply too slow, taking 20 hours for a full and 12 hours for an incremental, putting load on both server and client. The testing process was somewhat tedious, since I had to wait overnight each time for results. But I've finally found settings that work... using tar over ssh (rsh is not an option) reniced in a wrapper script on the backup client to -19. The full backups still take 20 hours (that's OK, we'll do full backups on weekends), but the incrementals are done in 3 hours. Bingo.

Warm weather, great sights, quiet hotel, and best of all, we could sleep in (twice!) without the tap-tap-tap of little feet coming into our bedroom.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately Mama came down with a head cold, so we had to hold off on some of the walking and let her nap in the afternoon.

Now we're even.</p>\n<p>Rome is a compact city with a cheap and functional Metro (note I don't say clean, spacious or comfortable), so it's easy to see a lot with just your feet and a map. Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, St. Peter's Square, Sistine Chapel (yes, Mama did decide to set foot at the Vatican after all), Colosseum, Forum.  </p>\n<p>I'm surprised how German my eye has become. I first noticed that half the moving sidewalks at the airport were broken. I noticed how slow the Airport 'Express' to the city travelled, how many people were in uniform not doing anything, and how the conversation in the street was always loud, fast and furious. I'm sure these are all prejudices, to which there is always a little truth. </p>\n<p>I was impressed with how the entire city seemed to be walking on the Via del Corso on Saturday evening. The coffee everywhere is good... even the train station kiosk has a commercial espresso machine. And despite the speed of the traffic, if you step onto the crosswalk, it will usually stop for you... or speed around you.</p>\n<p>We enjoyed ourselves, and we are already planning our next trip. We'll learn a few words of Italian for next time, and we'll bring Christopher along.

We had a cart full of suitcases, 3 cats, but no furniture, no apartment, no car, and our life savings in a cashier's check. We had only one job for the two of us. And only my wife could speak the language.</p>\n<p>The idea of moving to Germany had only occurred to us 2 months before. We had been in Arizona for a year, following a potential job that never materialized and landing in the middle of the real estate slump (remember Charles Keating?). Someone suggested that it would be a good time for Mama to return to Germany... the Wall was down, and business would be expanding. That someone had contacts with the international division of her company, phone calls were made, and she was offered a job. We decided to hitch our wagon to her star, and she accepted. July 1990 was World Cup in Italy. We jokingly told one another than if the Germans won, we would leave. They did, and we left. We wanted to stay for 5 years. We're now on 13.</p>\n<p>Business <em>was</em> good in Germany in the '90s, and with her American work ethic  and German determination, she was able to work her way further than she ever could have in the States. And we now have a house and a child, and we just can't pick up and change continents on a whim like we did back then. But with Germany now in a seemingly permanent slump, I can't help but wonder... if we had lived our lives 13 years later, and we were being offered the German opportunity now instead of in 1990, would we accept it? Somehow I think the answer would be no.</p>"},{fields:{title:"No Complaints",date:"02 Sep 2003",slug:"/2003-09-02-no-complaints/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>The relaunch of my work site has now been up over a week, with no negative comments.

The red dot is supposed to stay at the bottom of the screen, or get pushed down if the menus are too long (i.e. if the top of the dot is higher than the bottom of the menus, the position of the dot is changed from absolute to static). It doesn\'t work yet in Konqueror (the dot is always statically positioned, even if there\'s plenty of room), and I\'m guessing it doesn\'t work yet in Safari either.</p>\n<p>The menus are dynamically generated from a simple XML file (originating from an Excel table saved as CSV text) with the buttons created from Type 1 fonts with GD and t1lib (first time I\'ve used GD in production, I was always unhappy with quality before), cached, of course (the filenames are md5sums of the arguments passed to the GD script).

And I also remember thinking back then that, from his timing of the war, President Bush was handing the fate of his re-election away from US voters and to the Iraqi people. If, say, in the summer of 2004 the occupation is going badly, the Iraqis do not feel liberated and \'better off than they were 4 years ago\', if US soldiers are still killing and being killed, Iraq would then dominate the US election and Bush would be like LBJ in 1968, namely toast.</p>\n<p>I also decided back in April that it would take at least 6 months to draw any conclusions as to whether the occupation is going well or poorly.

The local Greens split into two parties over the war in Kosovo. Grassroots parties form on the right, join the government for a term, then disappear.

This is a sysadmin voodoo post.</p>\n<p>I maintain several FreeBSD machines. When a security alert is issued, the standard procedure is to update the source for your release with cvs or cvsup, then recompile and reinstall the system with 'make buildworld' and 'make installworld'. It's also fairly standard procedure to <a title=\"Tracking for Multiple Machines\" href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/small-lan.html\">'make buildworld' on one machine</a>, then export /usr/src and /usr/obj read-only via NFS to do installworld on the target machine. </p>\n<p>However, my FreeBSD machines are behind a firewall inside a DMZ. I can't mount NFS through the firewall, and I don't really want to be compiling systems on underpowered small-disk single-purpose machines in a DMZ. At first, I used installation CDs to update major versions. This is not very flexible and may not include the latest security patches. Lately I've been plugging the DMZ machines temporarily into the LAN to update over NFS. This is unelegant and may damage the cables and switches (not to mention my fingers) when unplugging.</p>\n<p>However, through trial and error (I haven't seen this tip anywhere), I figured out that after running 'make buildworld' on the build machine, I can burn /usr/src and /usr/obj on CD, and then run 'make installworld' from it on the target machines. The trick is you can't just have symlinks from /usr/src and /usr/obj to the CD. You've got to have actual mounts. In this case, <a title=\"mount_null (8)\" href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_null&amp;sektion=8&amp;apropos=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+4.8-RELEASE\">null mounts</a> work wonders. (Ignore the bit about 'not fully supported' and 'this doesn't work'.) If the CD is mounted on /cdrom, then:<br />\n<code>mount -t null /cdrom/src /usr/src<br />\nmount -t null /cdrom/obj /usr/obj</code></p>\n<p>You can then cd /usr/src and do your make installs and mergemaster. If you're really brave, you can do this while your services are running (single-user mode is for wimps), and then your only downtime is the reboot.</p>"},{fields:{title:"No Mercy",date:"19 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-19-no-mercy/",tags:"Y2003"},html:"<p><a title=\"Deutsche Welle: Current Affairs\" href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_951523_1_A,00.html\">Deutsche Welle: No More Mercy for Hamburg's 'Judge Merciless'</a>: \"Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust fired the city-state's controversial interior minister on Tuesday.

He will speak with his US colleague Colin<br />\nPowell and with Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. It is the first US<br />\nvisit of the Foreign Minister since the Iraq war. At that time<br />\nGerman-American relations were heavily strained by the "no" of the German<br />\nGovernment to the war. Therefore Fischer\'s visit is also an attempt to<br />\nbetter relations. Questions for Hans Ulrich Klose of the SPD,<br />\nvice-chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Bundestag.</p>\n<p>NDR info.: Mr. Klose, how you judge the current relationship between the<br />\nUSA and Germany?</p>\n<p>Klose: It\'s beginning to improve. One must add however, the problems<br />\nbetween Europeans and Americans are not only attributable to the attitude<br />\nin the Iraq war. The relationship changed after the end of the cold war<br />\nand because America, not least due to the experiences in the Kosovo war,<br />\nhas at least partly lost interest in NATO. The Iraq war brought the debate<br />\nto a head.</p>\n<p>NDR info.: At that time you violently criticized the chancellor because of<br />\nhis categorical No to the participation of the German Federal Armed Forces<br />\nat the Iraq war. Do you see that differently today?</p>\n<p>Klose: No, there I must correct you: I did not criticize the chancellor<br />\nbecause of his No to the war, because I was also not for the war. I<br />\ncriticized the chancellor because of his diplomatic mistakes, the fact<br />\nthat he specified his position unilaterally, under the title of "the<br />\nGerman way", and he declared that, "whatever the UN decides, we will not<br />\nparticipate". This political behavior indeed questioned the very<br />\nprinciples of German foreign policy. And that was the core of my<br />\ncriticism.</p>\n<p>NDR info.: Now however the the arguments of US president, which at that<br />\ntime justified the war, are being disproved. Did he also no make clear<br />\nmistakes?</p>\n<p>Klose: The Americans made at least as many mistakes as the Europeans. One<br />\ncan say, the political management around this conflict was deplarably bad<br />\non both sides of the Atlantic. One of the largest American errors consists<br />\nof the fact that they did not plausibly state the reasons for their<br />\nintervention in Iraq. However, the error of the Europeans lay in the fact<br />\nthat many of them deliberately minimized the danger posed by Iraq.</p>\n<p>NDR info.: The question now is, how can German-American relations become<br />\ncloser again. Unofficially the USA wish that German German Federal Armed<br />\nForces soldiers would engage themselves in the postwar Iraq. Chancellor<br />\nSchroeder rejected this, Fischer also. Was this correct?</p>\n<p>Klose: I believe indeed that German soldiers in the Iraq would not be<br />\nuseful at present, in order to be honest, because one cannot go into such<br />\nan deployment without intensive preparation. Successes of the German<br />\nsoldiers with "nation building" in other parts of the world lay in it that<br />\nthey were excellently trained, with the right attitude to adjust to<br />\ncertain situations. One does not create that from today to tomorrow.<br />\nPerhaps it would be possible to refer to the civilian component. In Iraq<br />\nan entire country is to be developed, from the municipalities to up to the<br />\ncentral level. And there the Germans could bring in specific strengths.<br />\nAnd if it concerns a symbolic military gesture to to be made, surely also<br />\nthe chancellor and the foreign minister will be willing to discuss it.</p>\n<p>NDR info.: They have already said, a symbolic gesture is not enough, in a<br />\ncountry, in which there is so much to be actually done.</p>\n<p>Klose: Correct. Therefore it would be better, that each country would<br />\nbring in the strengths which they have. The principle must be however that<br />\nwe, the Germans, we, the Europeans, have no interest that the Americans<br />\nfaile in Iraq fail and withdraw themselves possibly prematurely. One can<br />\nformulate: the greater danger for stability in the Near East is not that<br />\nthe Americans might remain too long - no, the danger is that that they do<br />\nnot stay long enough.</p>'},{fields:{title:"NY Times: Springsteen's Homecoming, With 55,000 Guests",date:"16 Jul 2003",slug:"/2003-07-16-ny-times-springsteens-homecoming-with-55000-guests/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="We\'ve been all around the world.

And noone is mentioning that simplifying the tax system, cutting tax rates and subsidies such that the revenue effect is zero, is in and of itself a good thing, since it makes rational desicions easier. In the economic sense, it allows me to use my time more efficiently to make money and create jobs rather than to find tax loopholes.

But that\'s futuretalk.)</p>\n<p>But after my feed was <a title="Don Park\'s Blog" href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/06/23.html#a615">shamed by Don Park</a> as an example of funky RSS (and he used another f-word several times to express how he feels about funky RSS in general), I decided to defunkify my feed (starting with the <a href="http://www.mediagap.org/mt/mt-rss.txt">template</a> by Alexander Barnes Dryer <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/23#When:8:13:39AM">mentioned by Dave Winer</a>). The result of my effort for now is <a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/index_xml_250603.txt">this template</a>.</p>\n<p>Now my head is spinning, a dangerous condition this early in the morning, and I can confirm that thinking about RSS causes severe brain damage. And my feed is only <em>mostly</em> defunkified, because I still have a content:encoded element because, well, I like having all the markup. So I still don\'t pass the <a href="http://www.thereisnocat.com/funkidator/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.papascott.de%2Findex.xml&mode=funkidate&funkidate=Funkidate Me%21">Funkidator</a>. </p>\n<p>This still won\'t make everyone happy.

I disagree that the licenses are all that different. Movable Type has _never_ been a free program. You've always had to pay for commercial use. The problem in this case is how to define 'commercial use'... at what point is setting up MT for a private user 'commerical use'? Likewise, a license for CityDesk does not give one the right the set up the program for another user... one has to get an additional license.</p>\n<p>Coming from the Linux and free software communinty, maybe I'm more accustomed to reading licences carefully and the type of license offered for Movable Type. We differentiate between 'free as in beer' and 'free as in speech', and it's always been clear to me that MT is only 'free as in beer'. Just like the free version of CityDesk. Perhaps it's confusing because MT is a Perl script in clear text, that one can look at and change. </p>\n<p>Six Apart cannot 'pull the rug out from under' MT users, even if they wanted to. Once you have agreed to the license and have obtained a certain version of the software, Six Apart cannot change it for that software that you already have. For example, they could decide to today that MT 2.64 and higher are no longer free for personal use. Everyone that already has MT 2.64 would not (and could not) be bound by the change. The change would only apply to all future users, and present users who wanted to update to the new version. (Fog Creek could do the same thing to CityDesk users. If they were to, say, increase the price by a factor of 10 and charge that price for all upgrades to 2.0, you could still continue to use 1.0.31 for the price you already paid.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, it looks like the people at Six Apart are being as reasonable as they can be without compromising their business.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Deeds instead of words",date:"24 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-24-deeds-instead-of-words/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="How Europe can _really_ become a stronger voice" href="http://www.eamonn.com/archives/000506.html#000506">Rainy Day: Deeds instead of words</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Internet For Poets: DNS",date:"23 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-23-internet-for-poets-dns/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="Please, would you tell me what you call yourself?" href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001297.htm">Burningbird: Internet For Poets: DNS</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Cacophony",date:"23 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-23-cacophony/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>Four months ago it looked like Chancellor Schr√∂der was on the ropes, and would soon be down and out. The economy and the budget were in ruins, he was battered  in local elections, he had a vocal but pointless policy on Iraq, he was caught between election promises and political realities, he faced dissent in his own ranks and a united opposition fully in charge of the Bundesrat. </p>\n<p>These days it all looks different. Actually, all of those conditions still hold, except now it\'s the Union that is in tatters, not the SPD. An <a title="Im Chor der Union stimmt kaum noch ein Ton" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/06/21/178931.html">editorial</a> (in German) in Saturday\'s Abendblatt describes the cacophony (a word Schr√∂der was using 4 months ago to chastise his own party) in the Union.</p>\n<p>A couple of examples: This past week the Merkel and Stoiber did an end-run around their own health care expert Seehofer to present a most unsocial health care plan (co-payments for everything! for everybody!). The loyal Seehofer nearly resigned, and the Bundestag debate took place without him. This coming week the cabinet will be considering moving up a planned tax cut, to be financed by cutting subsidies. The mantra of the Union for the past 2 years has been cutting taxes and subsidies, but now that it looks like Schr√∂der is going to do it, the leading figures in the Union are rushing to protect their favorite barrels of pork (tax credit for commuters! subsidies for house buyers!). Bavaria has local elections in a couple of months, and it seems the Union will be frozen in the headlights until then.</p>\n<p>There\'s nothing like a little policy-making responsibility (the firm Bundesrat majority) to show how much, or in this case, how little backbone an opposition has. The moderate Merkel, the conservative Koch, and the odd-man-out Stoiber are doing a strange dance to work out who is really in charge of the Union. It looks like the music will be playing until 2006, the next national elections, if not longer, and the only one smiling is Schr√∂der.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Baghdad Bulletin - Independent news from Iraq",date:"23 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-23-baghdad-bulletin-independent-news-from-iraq/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="English language news dedicated to covering the redevelopment of Iraq" href="http://www.baghdadbulletin.com/">Baghdad Bulletin - Independent news from Iraq</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Baseball on its ear",date:"22 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-22-baseball-on-its-ear/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="Instapundit.com:" href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/010213.php#010213">Instapundit</a> points to a Matt Welch article on <a title="NATIONAL POST" href="http://www.nationalpost.com/review/story.html?id=BEE0DE33-3215-4E9F-933B-C1951689F7FC">Turning baseball on its ear</a>, how the the unconventional Bill James method of looking at statistics (bases, runs and wins instead of hits) is making its mark on professional baseball.

A very <em>round</em> birthday, as they say in German (meaning it ends with a zero, and in this case, begins with a four), so it is a very special day indeed. Now we\'ve long since decided that giving one another presents is somewhat, well, <em>albern</em>, er, I <a href="http://dict.leo.org/?search=albern">mean</a>, inane, absurd, daft.

There\'s always jewelry, you might say, but my taste is nowhere near as good as hers, and I think we\'ll save the jewelry for the <a href="/2002/09/07/1875.php">20-year anniversary</a> coming up this fall.

And she has mentioned a couple of times this year that she would like a new one.

So I found a carton about the size of a jewelry box, pasted several bicycle pictures on the inside, folded, sealed and wrapped it. </p>\n<p>I think it was a good idea, as she proudly explained to her nephew on the phone that she got a <em>bicycle</em> for her birthday.

But just as the captain was telling us about sailing on the Alster (a permit is not required, but you need to leave a &euro;30 deposit in case you capsize), a sailboat did in fact capsize, right in front of our boatload of tourists. The 3 boaters were not able to able to right the boat by themselves, so we circled around and gave them a boost.

How the main themes in Iranian weblogs are not politics, but sex and loneliness. How teenagers are the main age group of webloggers in Poland.</p>\n<p>These communities, these <em>stories</em> were new to me, and it was very exciting to me. I'm looking forward to learning more about them, especially Poland, since they are my neighbors, soon to by my fellow citizens, yet Poland is mentioned so little in the German media (except in Harald Schmidt monolouges). And I'm wondering how we can overcome the barrier of language in bringing together international communities on the web. (Ironically, at the conference I got an email from a provider of translation services who asked if weblogs could be a marketing opportunity. Yes, yes, yes!)</p>\n<p>The other highlight was getting to know some of these 'serious' people and finding them to be very personable. They may be weblogging for their work, but they are having fun with their weblogs as well. Even if all the knowledge management in the world can <em>not</em> help you find cake in downtown Vienna at 1 am. </p>\n<p>So, like Ford Prefect writing about the Earth for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I'm going to have to update my personal definition of weblogs from 'useless'. They are now 'mostly useless'. And if 'serious' webloggers can enable conferences to take place where so much socializing can take place, then I guess that's OK. I'll be at the next one.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Fire at Hosting Matters",date:"28 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-28-fire-at-hosting-matters/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="In case you\'re missing InstaPundit today..." href="http://ahawkins.org/comments.php?id=P1214_0_1_0">Code the Web Socket: Fire at Hosting Matters</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Blogs Opening Iranian Society?",date:"28 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-28-blogs-opening-iranian-society/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="Report from BlogTalk" href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58976,00.html">Wired News: Blogs Opening Iranian Society?</a></p>'},{fields:{title:"Please Don't Not Smoke",date:"27 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-27-please-dont-not-smoke/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>To follow up on <a href="/2003/05/10/2224.php">Smoking for Health Care</a>, it\'s being reported today that the proposed &euro;1 cigarette tax <a href="http://www.heute.t-online.de/ZDFheute/artikel/21/0,1367,WIRT-0-2048021,00.html">will not be imposed all at once</a> on  January 1, but will instead be introduced in stages of 40, 30 and 30 cents.

I don\'t think so, but I think the female psychopaths are likely to be more subtle.)</p>\n<p>But afterwards, I got to thinking that it\'s not really an either-or question.

Smoking for health care may make as little sense as making love for virginity, but the Red-Green coalition is proposing a &euro;1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax to help finance the health insurance system. The package aims to decrease premiums from 14.4% to less than 13% of gross wages. </p>\n<p>The cigarette tax should bring in &euro;4 billion, just 20% of the &euro;20 billion savings needed. So guess who pays the difference? For the most part, the partients, since other parts of the package include raising co-payments on prescriptions (to between &euro;4 and &euro;8), removing sick and maternity pay from the health insurance system, and various incentives (i.e. fees) to discourage patients from going directly to a specialist without seeing their family doctor first. </p>\n<p>This puts the state even deeper in a moral hole. The health minister would like to discourage smoking, but the finance minister needs the money from the tobacco tax. This kind of reminds of the Woody Allen story about his brother who thought he was a chicken. They didn\'t want to bring him to a doctor, because they needed the eggs.</p>'},{fields:{title:"How To Cook Quick Links, Bork Bork Bork!",date:"10 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-10-how-to-cook-quick-links-bork-bork-bork/",tags:"Y2003"},html:"<p>Danger, danger, this post contains PHP code! Also note I've changed my mind a bit and put the quick links below any main posts for the day, rather than above.</p>\n<p>Note that the qlinks are saved in a separate blog. I'm not sure if that's the best idea or not... I could have defined a category for quick links. But it's difficult to define different entry formats for categories using MT tags. I find using a separate blog easier, then including the files with quick links in the index of the main blog, so the main blog always has the newest quick links without rebuilding. However, using a separate blog makes finding the links for each day somewhat complicated.  </p>\n<p>Each day can be found in /YYYY/MM/DD/qlinks.inc. I could just include this file in the MTDateFooter for each main post... EXCEPT that I would then miss the quick links for the days where I had no main post. So in the MTDateHeader, I need to check all the dates between the current and the previous post.</p>\n<p>At the top of the index template (before the MTEntries tag at any rate) we need to define some variables to make it easier to calculate dates:</p>\n<pre>&lt;?php \n$offset=0;\ndefine(DAY,60*60*24);\ndefine(NOW,time());\n?&gt;</pre>\n<p>Since NOW is defined in seconds, we have count back DAYs in seconds as well. The $offset keeps track of which days we've already checked. </p>\n<p>The meat of the script is in the MTDateHeader, where we check each day before the date of the current entry for quicklinks, before we output anything for the current day. For each day, we print a header and include the quick links only if a quick links file exists for that day.</p>\n<pre>&lt;MTDateHeader>\n&lt;?php\n  $mt_date='&lt;$MTEntryDate format=\"%d %B %Y\"$>';\n  $ql_date=date('d F Y',NOW-$offset*DAY);\n  while ($ql_date<>$mt_date) {\n    $inc_file=date('./Y/m/d/',NOW-$offset*DAY)\n      .'qlinks.inc';\n    if (is_readable($inc_file)) {\n      echo '&lt;h2>',$ql_date,'&lt;/h2>';\n      @include($inc_file);\n    }\n    $offset++;\n    $ql_date=date('d F Y',NOW-$offset*DAY);\n  }\n?>\n&lt;h2><$MTEntryDate format=\"%d %B %Y\"$>&lt;/h2>\n&lt;/MTDateHeader></pre>\n<p>Then we do all our normal entry stuff. After that, we need an MTDateFooter for the current day's quick links.</p>\n<pre>&lt;MTDateFooter>\n&lt;?php \n@include('<$MTEntryDate format=\"./%Y/%m/%d/qlinks.inc\"$>');\n$offset++;\n?&gt;</pre>\n<p>The @ before 'include' means there will be no warning message if the file does not exist. </p>\n<p>I'm not particularly happy that I have up to 15 separate includes on my index page. A cleaner solution would be to put all the quick links into an RSS file, and loop through that. I'll do that in version 0.02.</p>\n<p>Or I may even put the quick links back on the sidebar.

The Hamburg election in 2001 was held just days after 9/11, but the issue of crime had been a thorn in the the side of the SPD mayors Vorscherau and Runde for years. Schill attracted a lot a media attention as a criminal judge (sentencing vandals to jail time) and critic of both the SPD and his fellow judges. Not surprisingly, he was 'demoted' to civil court and switched to politics, starting his own party.</p>\n<p>Schill made wild promises about hiring 1000 new police officers and cutting crime by 1/2 within 100 days of taking office. That hasn't happened, of course, but crime is down (according to Schill's statistics), and he's done some media stunts like proposing blue police uniforms and cars instead of the traditional green. Just today, he was in the <a href=\"http://www.abendblatt.de/\">paper</a> twice... once for blocking a state contract with the local church (he doesn't like the bishop, and says 'no Hamburger should kneel before the church'), and again for raising the speed limit on certain autobahn stretches.

Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940-1945.\" href=\"http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3549071655/qid=1048739482/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/302-0079855-0700062\">Der Brand</a>, the historical account of 'Germany in the bombing war 1940-1945'. I've finished the first two sections entitled 'Waffe' and 'Strategie'. Since a couple of readers have mentioned that they will be reading it as well, I'll give my impressions so far.</p>\n<p>This book looks at the bombing from the point of view of the civilian victims on the ground, the 500,000 dead and 30 million homeless. Most of them were not in Hamburg and Dresden, but in middle sized cities throughout Germany, in bombing raids that made no headlines but killed a few hundred people each night.</p>\n<p>Is such a view of any value today? Does it have any meaning for non-historians to look at the 'victims' that belonged to an aggressor nation? I think yes. First, this is the gestation of modern Germany, the hour before 'Hour Null'. The earliest pictures of post-war Germany tend to be the <em>Trummerfauen</em>, the women carrying away the rubble in the cities by hand. We don't see what created the rubble, and what those women endured before it was safe enough to begin the cleanup. I think it's important to know that to understand Germany's view of itself and its place in Europe and the world today, what ties to the past were shattered by the bombs and what ties remained. </p>\n<p>Second, by today's standards we distinguish between 'regime' and 'civilians', at least we try, and today's weapon technology is capable of that to some degree. The weapons of 60 years ago were not as selective. Success was dropping a bomb within two miles of target, and success rates were 30% or less, with 5% loss of aircraft and crews for each raid (as long as the German air defense still existed). Those weapons were not precise enough to target only a factory or a railway station. A neighborhood was as precise as they could get.</p>\n<p>The bombing of civilian neighborhoods had the military objectives of causing economic collapse through millions of homeless and shortage of factory workers, and of demoralizing the civilian population. Neither objective was achieved. Was the bombing of German cities a war crime? I don't think that this is a question that can be answered today. We cannot apply today's standards to the actions of a generation and a half ago. And victors, by definition, are never tried for war crimes. I am, however, very glad that I do not have to make the difficult decisions that Churchill and the Allied military leaders of the time had to make. I'm not sure I'd be able to sleep nights, no matter what I chose.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Water Cannons Continued",date:"26 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-26-water-cannons-continued/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>Today the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/03/25/2134.php">police action from Monday</a> appears in a better light.

Trying to keep Apache and PHP current on them is a nightmare, since current RPM packages are not available for old distributions. (MSSQL admins learned over the weekend how important it is to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/29027.html">keep your servers  current</a>.) And I simply do not like the way Mandrake packages Apache (with separate servers with and without mod_perl).</p>\n<p>Building my own RPMs would be silly, since I only have one of each box, so I would still have to compile 5 different Apaches. I have been using <a title="ApacheToolbox" href="http://www.apachetoolbox.com/">ApacheToolbox</a> to try to keep things somewhat organized. But compiling a current PHP on an older box with ApacheToolbox is still a nightmare, since 1) it installs PHP as a static module, so updating PHP means updating everything, and 2) PHP gets confused about which libs (system or ApacheToolbox) to link. Given that my boxes are busy with other tasks, trial and error with PHP/Apache compiles takes literally hours.</p>\n<p>Today I happened upon a solution. Compile ApacheToolbox <em>without</em> PHP, then compile PHP as a dynamic module with apxs. ApacheToolbox without PHP compiled and installed cleanly on all boxes, and since PHP only looked for system libraries, it was easy to sort them out. I was able to update all my boxes with various PHP extensions before noon.</p>\n<p>Doing this under FreeBSD is much easier, thanks to the <a href="http://www.freshports.org/">ports</a>.</p>'},{fields:{title:"Old European Stereotypes",date:"26 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-26-old-european-stereotypes/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>In their reporting on the 40th anniversary of the <a title="Economist.com" href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1545760">Elys√©e treaty</a> (and before the Rumsfeld remarks on \'Old Europe\'), our <a href="http://www.ndrinfo.de">local news radio station</a> interviewed people in Paris about their stereotype of Germans.

I could only think that they wanted to prevent such a resolution from coming to a vote at all, or they wanted to extremely irritate Tony Blair.

He called Germany and France \'problems\' and \'the Old Europe\', and his reaction acknowledged that \'the Old Europe\' does indeed make a difference. Maybe Chirac and Schr√∂der had outfoxed Bush after all, blindsiding him by announcing their intentions <em>before</em> the Blix report that Bush has been waiting for. After the Blix report, the US will appear to be proactive by either bowing to the Security Council or by going ahead without them. Either option involves at a minimum a loss of face.

The EU does things that are either the lowest common denominator of the member states or that don't matter at all. (I'll let the reader decide which category applies to EU foreign policy.) In the end, as happened once again last week in Copenhagen, the EU does what is decided by the French President and the German Chancellor behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>I don't think that theories of elitism apply to the bit of Europe I'm most familiar with.

Blood and upbringing do not matter in modern Germany. Only money.</p>\n<p>German political leaders tend to have rather humble backgrounds. Kohl and Stoiber both came from families of low-level civil servents, Merkel was East German physics professor, Fischer was a rock-throwing radical, and Schr√∂der grew up with a single mother in poverty. They came into power not because of who their parents were, or where they studied, but because they very early became involved in (or founded) political parties.</p>\n<p>I do agree with Steven on one point.

Stoiber's majority in the west came from his landslide in Bavaria (42.2% to 33.1%). If Bavaria is excluded, the SPD handily won the 'rest of the west' (40.8% to 36.4%).

In the Diplomacy hobby, she was a legend. She could lie, cheat and stab in the back with the best of them, and in Diplomacy, those are compliments. (Diplomacy is like a stylized form of the game of Risk, but only if you could say that chess is a stylized form of tic-tac-toe.) </p>\n<p>She was also my friend, back in the 1980s when I was involved in the play-by-mail Diplomacy hobby. That was (and is) a community much like the weblog community, except the technology then was mimeograph, typewriters, photocopies, pen and ink, envelopes, stamps, and sometimes the telephone. Someimes we'd even travel cross-country to meet one another and play for a weekend. I was an awful player, but I enjoyed the company, and enjoyed producing a chatty zine, which I called 'Irksome'. That's how I met Kathy and her husband John, then living in Queens, New York. A brash-talking New Yorker, I'm not sure how she hit it off with a shy Minnesota boy, but we got along fine. She even got to know Mama, who was still in Germany, by mail, and on Mama's first visit to the States we went to New York to stay with John and Kathy for a week. </p>\n<p>Even though I hadn't heard from her in over 10 years, I'm sure that if we had ever met up again, within 5 minutes we'd be caught up. However, last month, I found out (via <a href=\"http://devel.diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/\">The Abyssinian Prince</a>) that Kathy had just died after a quick but severe bout with lung cancer. I nearly mentioned her here then, and was thinking of her when I wrote <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/index.php?p=1876&more=1&c=1\">Young, Dumb and Excited</a>, the saga of our wedding day, since Mama's first stop in the States on her way to marry me was to stay overnight with John and Kathy. This past weekend, I heard from John, and I was able to gather some thoughts about Kathy for him. Mama thought that I had expressed myself well, so as my tribute to Kathy, I'll include my thoughts here, hoping that they will make some sense to those who never knew her.</p>\n<p>\"I hope all this public reminiscing is helping to soften the blow of losing Kathy, a woman who was very, very special. I remember you two most not for anything that happened in the hobby, but how you helped us when Mama came from Germany to the States, when both she and I were both young and silly enough to decide to live in the same country and get married. Yes, Mama slept with you two before she slept with me, at least on that trip. We've never forgotten that.</p>\n<p>\"In the bobby, I remember the Maniacal game, GMed by Bob Osuch, where we were going for a 17-17 draw and she stabbed me on the last turn to take the win. In the end I wasn't surprised to be stabbed, and not at all bitter. I can't remember the other players anymore. John Michalski? Dick Martin? I never was a good Diplomacy player, but finishing second to Kathy made me look, and feel, good.</p>\n<p>\"And, yes, there was a wild ride in a rental car from the KC airport to Wichita for Pudge Con with Kathy and Al Pearson. I don't remember any details, just that the entire ride was hilarious. We kept wishing we weren't in Kansas anymore, but we were always still there.</p>\n<p>\"And Mama and Kathy did invent the Beer River variant (pour a beer on the Diplomacy board, forming a river from Moscow through Munich to Paris that fleets can follow). Did that variant ever get registered?</p>\n<p>\"As you might imagine, Mama wears the (financial) pants in the family. She's a regional manager for (her employer in) Germany, in charge of 210 locations in northern Germany, and the first woman to advance as high in the company. She has a big, fat BMW 530 as a company car, and that helps make up for the travel and the long hours. I work as a webmaster for a e-banking software company in Hamburg. And we do have a little Hanson. Christopher will turn 3 in December. What little free time we have revolves around him.</p>\n<p>\"My only tie to the Diplomacy hobby these days is TAP, which I get via email, and which I try to at least skim each issue. I keep a personal weblog at <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/\">http://www.papascott.de/</a>, where I sometimes put Christopher pictures, but mostly ramble. It's like a zine where I don't have to bother GMing any games.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks for getting in touch, John. I feel lucky to have known both you and Kathy, and  I've missed out by not getting in touch with you guys since leaving the hobby.

He'd just come back from a summer in Brazil, she was from Germany and currently an exchange student in a neighboring town. They became sweethearts, went to prom, graduated, she returned to Germany, they promised to 'stay in touch', he went to college.  Six months later they resolved to remain sweethearts. She still had 3 years to finish her Abitur, her parents had no telephone, Al Gore hadn't yet invented the Internet, so they wrote 3 letters a week. The first summer he visited her, the second summer she visited him, and the third summer she came to stay.</p>\n<p>The plan was that she would transfer her Abitur credits to the University of Minnesota, study geography or something, maybe play volleyball, and the two would live together without money as a happy student couple for the foreseeable future. </p>\n<p>Ah yes, without money. That was the hangup. To enter the country on a student visa, you have to have the financing of your education arranged ahead of time. In Germany, financing an education is a foreign concept (as is having to pay for an education). Parental support was out, as her parents 1) didn't have the money, and 2) weren't supportive of the move. The couple wasn't aware of any 'Study in America to be with your sweetheart' scholarship programs, so the student visa was out.</p>\n<p>However, a <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/visa;fiancee.html\">fianc&eacute;e visa</a> was more in their price range. Thirty-five dollars up front, piles of forms, but no proof of financial status required. He was working part-time at the <a href=\"http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/lawlibrary/lawlib.htm\">county law library</a> (I forget whether at this time he was determined to become a lawyer, or whether he had been at the law library long enough to have determined not to become a lawyer). He could find out about the piles of forms. She could go the consulate, prove she was a non-Communist without communicable disease, get her ticket and go. </p>\n<p>Never mind that in the time they had had a serious relationship, they had been together for just 6 weeks (physically, as together in the same room or continent, as opposed to emotionally or spiritually, as in <a href=\"http://www.xrefer.com/entry/630372\">cloud cuckoo land</a>). Or that, despite being married to a Minnesota resident, she would have to pay non-resident tuition for 3 years. As I said, our heroes were young, dumb and excited.</p>\n<p>So she arrived in July, with a backpack on her back and nothing in her pocket. He welcomed her into their new apartment, a small rathole near Loring Park (by the next summer they would move to a larger rathole near the College of Art and Design and the <a href=\"http://www.blackforestinnmpls.com/\">Black Forest Inn</a>). She looked for work, but the job market didn't have a whole lot of positions available for fresh Abitur graduates with a native knowledge of German. Except in the fast-food industry, which she entered in mid-August.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there was the matter of that fianc&eacute;e visa, and the small stipulation that \"the marriage must take place within 90 days of admission into the United States\". This was not a step they were particularly looking forward to. But take it they must. From work, he knew of a particularly sympathetic female judge, and made an appointment with her clerk for the morning of the day after Labor Day. He figured the government center would not be very busy then.</p>\n<p>So, on the morning of September 6th, 1983, the apprehensive couple headed off on the bus to downtown Minneapolis. At the government center, they were met by four witnesses and guests, one of whom had brought a blender. She figured they needed at least one trapping of a traditional wedding. They took the elevator to the 19th floor, and Judge Sedgwick put it all to rest. There are very few photos still in existence that document this event. Later, they noticed that they had never paid the judge the 25 dollars for her efforts.</p>\n<p>Leaving their guests and witnesses behind, their next step was breakfast at her new employer. Her boss was somewhat befuddled that her new employee would come in for breakfast on her wedding day, and gave them breakfast for free. The boss is still friends with the couple to this day. She had a somewhat more opulent wedding last year, far better documented with pictures.</p>\n<p>They then boarded a bus for the long journey to St. Paul, home of the regional office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the St. Paul Post Office. There they filed the paperwork proving that they had complied with the stipulations of the fianc√©e visa (the clerk noticed that the ink was still wet on the license) and to apply for her permanent residency (an adventure in which she would be sent four Green Cards with typographical errors before finally receiving a card with everything spelled correctly).</p>\n<p>Next stop was an Irish pub for lunch. He had a lot of mail to prepare. He was involved in the hobby of Play-By-Mail Diplomacy, and published a fanzine with various games and articles. His readers had been following the fate of the apprehensive couple very closely, and he wanted to provide them with a special issue of the zine postmarked with the wedding date and the location of the consumation of the wedding at the INS. So with a pint of Guinness they stuffed envelopes and licked stamps.</p>\n<p>From here the details are more fuzzy. It is a fact that the evening was spent at Foxy's, a lesbian nightclub where a friend was DJ on Tuesday nights. Since neither of the two particularly enjoys to dance, they probably had way too much beer and caught one of the last buses back to Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>There, they had to transfer and wait 20 minutes at Uptown. The woozy couple laughed and thought it would be funny if she ended up dropping her studies and running the fast-food location directly behind the bus stop. Little did they know at the time that is exactly what would happen.</p>\n<p>(We heard the phrase 'young, dumb and excited' used by Minnesota Viking punter Greg Coleman to describe rookie quarterback Jim McMahon of the Chicago Bears. The phrase has stuck in our memories.)</p>"

There are a lot of settings that have to be just right before it will run. That's the nature of a CGI. It is a complete program that runs by itself (inheriting a number of environment variables from the web server), and needs to be explicitly given certain bits of information (like where to read and write files). </p>\n<p>MT also demands a lot a resources, because 1) that's the nature of a CGI, being called as a separate program by the web server, and 2) the design decision to write static HTML files for all archives. When the archive templates are changed, all archive files need to be rewritten. For PapaScott that's a couple thousand files. My hoster restricts how much CPU time a CGI can take, so MT times out before it can write out all its files. </p>\n<p>CGI is a clunky, old fashioned way to program web services, slow and resource hungry. Ten years ago there was no other way to do it. These days it belongs in the same dustbin as Netscape 4. However, precisely because CGI is old fashioned, it is available at nearly all web hosters, so that is why I think Ben and Mena chose to develop MT as a CGI. </p>\n<p>pMachine is easier because a PHP page is not a complete program. It is text parsed by the PHP program, which is usually installed as an Apache module, so it (sort of) becomes part of the web sever itself. pMachine creates entry and archive pages on the fly, so it doesn't need to write any HTML files, saving the associated overhead and setup headaches. All pMachine needs to know is where to find the database.</p>\n<p>Paul's criticism of the MT documentation is somewhat unfair, since the docs are designed for a user at a commercial hoster with no means or knowledge of setting up the web server. MT does work just fine for me with a standard Apache installation (Linux distributions tend to screw up Apache, so SuSE and Red Hat don't count as standard installations).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'll probably stick with MT for now. My hoster has worked out the MySQL issues, so I can use the database again. I do like the user interface and the design, and I don't feel like switching to something completly different right now. I'm writing up PHP versions of the archive templates so I can serve archive pages on the fly. Then I won't have the problems with rebuilding. I have a working entry template already, and I'll post them all when I have them all ready and more-or-less usable.</p>\n<p>As for and OS and software that just work, I don't think there is any such thing, except for game consoles. Turn on your PlayStation, plug in the cartridge, and play. It just works. Computers should work the same way.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Running On MT",date:"31 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-31-running-on-mt/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>I'm back on Movable Type, but I'm not a happy camper at the moment.

In the 80s we lived in Minneapolis, just as the gangs started moving in (see Prince: Sign O' The Times), and Mpls later became the murder capital of the US, at least for a couple of years. We then moved to Phoenix, where the large transient population (not in the sense of being homeless, but in the sense of having just come to town and being very likely to soon leave) does not engender a feeling of security. We were transient, too; we stayed just 18 months.</p>\n<p>This supposed feeling of security isn't really based on actual experience, by the way.

I thought the statistics on crime rates, gun ownership, etc. backed up my feeling that I was safer here than back in the US.</p>\n<p>But not now. I do not feel safer in Europe anymore. First there was 9/11, but everyone knows about that, and I won't dwell on it.

Violent acts in German schools isn't new, there have been a few such crimes the past decade, but this was particularly awful in its scale. It shows that controlling gun ownership doesn't prevent acts like this, and that Europe is not immune to the media culture of violence that seems to prevail in the US.</p>\n<p>Then came the shooting of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, 9 days before national elections. I'm not real up on Dutch politics, see Adam Curry for more details, but Pim Fortuyn was apparently on the verge of making a national impact in The Netherlands, and was murdered for his beliefs.

There's a TheXmlFiles tool for Radio 7 that can produce these, but it does not work for Radio 8. I downloaded Radio 7 from the same directory where Radio 8 is located (there's no link for it on the Radio website, as far as I can tell), and installed it in a separate directory from Radio 8. It produced a directory full of XML files, as described in the documentation for TheXmlFiles, which I zipped and copied over to my BSD machine.</p>\n<p>I wanted to process these files with Perl, but my perl tools complained about the special characters in the XML files, since I used German umlauts in several of my posts. The standard character set for XML is Unicode, but the umlauts were saved as Latin1, so I converted the XML files to Unicode with 'recode latin1..utf8'.</p>\n<p>Manila produces a discussion group message for each post, comment and image on the site. For now, I only wanted to import the main posts into my new site. The file homePageCalendar.xml lists the message number of the main post for each day. With the script <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/xmlexport.txt\">xmlexport.pl</a>. for each of these posts, I extracted the post date, title, and body into the text format used by MoveableType.</p>\n<p>In Manila, you can put image or link names in quotes to expand to a so-called glosary entry. The message files have these names in quotes, and they need to be expanded to the full image or link. I did this by running <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/xmlglossary.txt\">xmlglossary.pl</a> on the output from above. The image references now all refer to the Manila site. I uploaded all images to a directory on my new site, and search-and-replaced all references to refer to the new directory.</p>\n<p>There were a couple of problems I had to correct by hand. One day's entry had no text, so I simply deleted it from the homePageCalendar.xml file. One of the message xml files has a ctrl-S character that brought the scripts to a halt. I deleted it by hand, and everything ran smoothly.</p>\n<p><b>Postscript 2002-04-13</b> Chris Kelly notes that my scripts work if your content are all 'stories'. If you use Manila's news option, the content is stored differently and you'll need to adjust the script.</p>"

There live roughly 80,000 people. The German winter athletes are recruited from these 80,000 people, not from the 80 million German population. The succeses were all in endurance and strength disciplines (cross-country, speed skating). In the technical contests (alpine skiing, ice hockey, figure skating) the results were as usual. In cycling (Ullrich, Zabel), I had always wondered how long the DDR doping advantage would last. This was the wrong question, of course. The question should be, how do the trainers of today keep their athletes from being tested positive? The science of sport learned from German reunification.

The NPD is not making political inroads anywhere, its political impact is nil. The losses of the Greens are not <i>despite</i> the pro-war Fischer, but <i>because</i> of him; he's undercutting the pacifist base. Stoiber is talking now as a national candidate much differently than he did as a state prime minister. He could make Euroskeptic noises when leading Bavaria, but not now as a national leader.

First first a quick primer on German public broadcasting...</p>\n<p>The two German public networks have very different personalities. They're both governed by the states (or L√§nder), who also regulate private broadcasting and determine the monthly broadcast fees for listeners and viewers (and if you smell potential conflicts of interest, you're right). </p>\n<p>In short, ZDF is run by a committee of civil servents, while ARD is run by a consortium of committees of civil servents. Alles klar? The ZDF (Zweite Deutsche Fernsehen) is a single organization based in Mainz that does only national television. The ARD (Allgemeine Rundfunkanstalten Deutschlands... try saying that 3 times fast) is a consortium of the regional public broadcasters, each of which do regional television and radio and then try to agree which programs get broadcast nationally. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/literature/broadcst.htm\" title=\"Broadcasting Law in Germany\">By law</a> the public broadcasters have a duty to present diverse opinions, and are governed to insure 'internal plurality'. In practice this means that the two networks present a very institutional view of Germany and the world, with the views of parties, unions, big business and the church in the foreground.</p>\n<p>What does all this have to do with the Olympics? Well, I said that the ARD covrage was somewhat better. This is because the Bavarian regional broadcasters are in charge of the ARD coverage, and since Bavaria is the center of winter sport in Germany, they have a somewhat better perspective on winter sport than their ZDF colleagues from Mainz. The Bavarians also made the comment about the sport of Wei√übier, which sounds like a good sport for <a href=\"http://www.vfth.com/2001/09/07\">Alwin</a> and me.</p>"},{fields:{title:"Stop It, But Don't Blame Us",date:"19 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-19-stop-it-but-dont-blame-us/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Spiegel: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,183199,00.html">Zuwanderung: Union sagt Gespr√§che mit Koalition ab</a> (CDU/CSU call off immigration talks with coalition).

Here in Germany, the main coverage has been split between the two public networks, ARD and ZDF, switching every evening (as is usual for big sports events like the Olympics, World and European Cup, or World Track and Field Championships). We're 8 hours ahead of Salt Lake City, so the coverage begins about 4pm, the early afternoon events are in prime time, the hard core can keep watching until 5 or 6am.

The digital pay-TV network Prmiere World has 5 sports channels devoted to the Olympics, but we don't subscribe, so we don't have any details.</p>\n<p>ARD and ZDF are governed by politicians and financed by monthly fees paid by all TV owners.

In Germany life had indeed stopped for a time, but in the meantime had started again. In the States life hadn't yet really started. The feeling seemed to be fanned by the media, not only the news shows in series of artificial anniversaries (3 months since 9/11, 100 days since 9/11), but even talk shows, where the main topic seemed to be always dealing with the mental (or the economic) aftermath.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nA friend of mine gave a good analogy, although she was talking about the death of her father. The traumatic event was like a black hole in her memory, which she visualized like a brick in a bedsheet. In her memory, time was sucked into the funnel created by that brick, so that events that happened just before the traumatic event seemed decades away.</p>\n<p>For me, 9/11 did not change my world. Maybe it's because international politics was my minor in college, or maybe it's because I'm realistic, cynical, or maybe just sick. But after the shock and horror was gone, my view of the world had not changed. Such an event was possible. </p>\n<p>Maybe it's because my adopted country has had its own bout of terrorism, and security is more a way of life. The Schleyer kidnapping and the 'hot autumn' of 1977 was certainly a traumatic point in (West) Germany, but it was terrorism from inside, and the shock to the German establishment was that it no longer knew or even recognized its own children. It wasn't so much the violence.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's because Germany has had much experience with sudden sweeping change the past century. Losing two wars, mass destruction and occupation, totalitarianism, division, democratization, reunification. During the Cold War, it was matter-of-factly assumed that World War III would begin in Germany. For some Germans, the Euro is now the 6th currency in their lifetime (6 if you count black market cigarettes just after the war). The US experienced nothing like any of that. Pearl Harbor, perhaps. </p>\n<p>Or maybe it's because Islam is massively present in Germany. Muslims make up nearly 10% of the population. For my first job in Germany, I went back to what I had done in college. I was ashift manager for McDonald's. I worked with staffs that were overwhelmingly Muslim (Turkish and Iranian), and I became somewhat acquainted with Islam on a everyday level. I'm no expert, but I do know what Ramadan is.</p>\n<p>Two blocks from the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof is a street that looks like Little Istanbul. There is the very mosque where the perpetrators of 9/11 first spawned their plan. I have wondered, if they wanted to attack the West, why didn't they strike in Hamburg, where they already were? They were already in a rich developed nation. Why did they take the time and trouble to go to the US? Maybe they already knew what I just realized: that the United States was much more vulnerable, and that the impact of an attack there would be much deeper.

Here in Germany, of course, Mama State makes sure everyone has health insurance. The public system is financed similary to social security. Workers pay 13 to 14% of their pay (split between employer and employee) to a \'sickness fund\' for their family. The system also covers pensioners, the unemployed and welfare recipients. Self-employed and workers with high incomes can opt out to private insurance, but some 90% of Germans are in the public system.</p>\n<p>The public system is good for traditional one-earner families, but tough on double incomes. We both went private years ago, when we weren\'t planning on having a family. Children are covered automatically in the public system, but cost extra with private insurance. We also had to pay the full share of Mama\'s insurance during her maternity leave (the employer normally covers half). </p>\n<p>The public system has seen a lot of cost-cutting measures in the years we\'ve been here, with co-payments for prescriptions and dental work and cutbacks in what treatments are covered. The system is in need of reform, but it works.</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago when my mother was visiting, she had a bad flu and we took her on a Friday evening to the local doctor who was on call.

I also know for a fact that real world distortions can quickly erode these benefits. The critics of globalization do have some good arguments with respect to debt relief and fair trade, and they need to be considered by world leaders. But while the fringe of a G8 conference is a good place to get attention, it is a bad place to be listened to and to be taken seriously. The G8 or the EU are not world governments, and decisions are not made at summits. Politics takes place at the national level, and issues of globalization needs to be brought up at this level. </p>\n<p>Take, for example, agricultural subsidies, and the particularly crass case of the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pubs/cashingin_sugar/sugarindex.html">US sugar industry</a>. In a free market, the US would be importing most if not all of its sugar from developing countries. Instead, US sugar prices are held 50% higher than world market prices, and imports are blocked by quotas. The winners are corporations like <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mother_jones/SO95/kaplan.html">Archer</a> <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-02-97.html">Daniels</a> <a href="http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/publications/GEBriefings/controlfreaks/adm1.html">Midland</a> (since it would make no economic sense for <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/ndaq/news/investing/20001221c.asp">ADM</a> to produce corn syrup with low sugar prices).</p>\n<p>Money and power go hand in hand, and even in a democracy, money and politics are inseparable.

Back when I worked for <a href="http://www.int-res.com">Inter-Research</a>, the ecologist <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Staff/paul.htm">Paul Ehrlich</a> gave a <a href="http://www.int-res.com/eebooks/ee8.html">lecture</a> for us. He\'s well-known for his pessimistic view of the <a href="http://www.2think.org/tpe.shtml">population explosion</a>, but I found it interesting that <a href="http://www.dieoff.org/page43.htm">he uses units of energy to express the impact of population</a>: </p>\n<p>"The average rich-nation citizen used 7.4 kilowatts (kW) of energy in 1990-a continuous flow of energy equivalent to that powering 74 100-watt lightbulbs. The average citizen of a poor nation, by contrast, used only 1 kW.... Americans are superconsumers, and use inefficient technologies to feed their appetites. Each, on average, uses 11 kW of energy, twice as much as the average Japanese, more than three times as much as the average Spaniard, and over 100 times as much as an average Bangladeshi." </p>\n<p>(Ehrlich said that Germany lies near Spain on this scale, but I\'ll have to find a source of current statistics.)</p>\n<p>As for our own use of electricity, our last annual bill from <a href="http://www.ewe.de">EWE</a> was for 5500 kWH. Our monthly bill is Euro 69, and we seem to be paying 12 Eurocents per kWH.

One is to pull his bib up over his head during mealtimes. If I pull the bib back down and say 'No,' he cries and won't eat. If I leave the bib over his head, his face is covered and he can't eat, although eventually he'll pull the bib completely off and start again with his shirt, which of course has sleeves and cannot be pulled over his head, so he cries and won't eat. Toddler logic.</p>\n<p>It is also disconcerting that he takes possession of any object he can reach, especially anything that resembles a telephone. Remote controls are OK, and a cordless or, even better, a cell phone is especially good. (Cell phones for toddlers could be a real money maker for the cell phone providers, since toddlers dial at random and never hang up.)</p>\n<p>By the way, a Macintosh mouse, even though it has a cord, is a good substitute for a cordless phone, since itnot only fits in the hand like a telephone, but with the ball underneath can also be pushed across the floor like a car.

We<br />\ndidn't plan a strategy ahead of time, but looking back, our plan was:</p>\n<p>* Avoid the long lines. There are about 10 major attractions with long<br />\nlines, and we skipped most of them. There are hundreds of things to see<br />\nwithout any line at all. The most spectacular attraction, the 21st<br />\nCentury, has the longest line. If we go again, we'll to rush there<br />\nright at opening time. Hopefully it won't rain next time.</p>\n<p>* Baby carriage accessible? Mostly. We were scared from the lofty<br />\nHolland pavillion by both the line and the many stairs, but most of<br />\nthe halls are handicapped accessible. We carried Christopher into<br />\nseveral smaller exhibits.</p>\n<p>* Lots of rest stops. Christopher was often hungry, thirsty, tired, or<br />\nneeded changing. Don't rush, stay flexible?</p>\n<p>* Hungry? Use connections if you got them (Mama's employer is a<br />\nsponsoring partner of the Expo), or go ethnic. The country booths have<br />\nbetter and cheaper food than the stands outside.</p>\n<p>* Avoid the propaganda. Concentrate on the country booths. </p>\n<p>What did we see?

We just got a \"Baby's Cookbook\" with some nutrition hints.\n</li>\n<li>His diapers have increased in volume and pugnancy proportional to his intake of solid food. He likes to roll on the diaper table, not yet appreciating the drop to the floor.\n</li>\n<li>He's not crawling yet, but has increased his speed and mobility in rolling. He can roll across the living room in 2 seconds flat. It's definitely time to get guard rails for the stairs.\n</li>\n<li>He's become dangerously interested in cables and any loose objects within reach. He shakes things wildly in the air, and is surprised that it hurts when he hits himself in the head.\n</li>\n<li>He's sleeping long and soundly through the night, and naps for a couple of hours in the afternoon. Sometimes he naps in the morning too.\n</li>\n<li>He makes all sorts of different sounds, like he's testing the pitch and loudness of his voice. Sometimes it sounds like he's auditioning for the soundtrack of a horror film.\n</li>\n<li>We've taken him swimming twice, and his baths have become more active and wet (for parents and child) as a result.\n</li>\n<li>Mama thinks that he's already saying 'Mama', but to me it sounds like he's philosophizing about mammon or mums.

I'm sure that there must have been a lot of activity in the delivery room, after the cord was cut, the placenta was expelled and examined, and the episiotomy was sewn shut. I don't remember much of that. I just remember holding as best I could my wife and Christopher.</p>\n<p>I can't really compare childbirth in the US and in Germany, of course. We were loaned one American book (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380780399/qid=947419090/sr=1-1/104-9658493-2473257\">Pregnancy and Childbirth</a> by Tracie Hotchner), which was helpful for vocabulary but seemed very paranoid and depressed. My feeling about many passages in the book was \"I'm glad we're giving birth in Germany so we don't have to go through that!\" (Looking at Amazon, I see the reviews there are mixed.)</p>\n<p>I said in my first article that the PDA turned the birth into a clinical experience, but that isn't 100% true. I didn't have change into greens, and I don't remember anyone wearing masks, even during the delivery. When the PDA had set in, the midwife encouraged me to get into the bed with my wife and catch a few winks; the lights were turned down low and we were left alone. We never had to change rooms, and the delivery room did have a couple of padded chairs and a radio/cassette player so it didn't feel quite so shiny and sterile as a hospital room might feel. (We had recorded a couple of cassettes for the labor, but we never thought to put them in. We heard some Top 40 station all night long.)</p>\n<p>In Germany, a midwife is required to attend to every birth, and our midwife Vera was one of the best. We didn't choose her; she was simply on duty that night, but my wife knew her from the weekly acupuncture treatments. All the midwives we have met during the past 2 months seem to possess a kind of magic in their voices and in their hands. It might well be witchcraft, in the most positive sense of the word. Vera's encouragement and sense of what my wife was feeling might very well have made the difference that made a C-section unnecessary.</p>\n<p>My wife's health insurance entitled her to be treated by the head physician of the department...</p>\n<p><em>I never did finish this story.

Participating in the birth was more difficult psychologically than I ever imagined. I saw my wife suffering so badly at a fairly early stage of labor, and I knew the pain would only get worse before it would get better. I had no idea how to comfort her, much less how to deal with it myself!</i></p>\n<p>With Mama due on the 27th, we made sure not to make any fixed plans<br />\nover the holidays. At least, I thought we made sure. My wife forgot,<br />\nand invited her mother to stay overnight from the 25th to the<br />\n26th. \"But we might have to suddenly leave for the clinic,\" my wife explained to her mother. \"So you might have to find your own way to the train<br />\nstation.\" But she didn't really believe that anything would happen.</p>\n<p>But sure enough, my wife woke up at midnight feeling uncomfortable, and<br />\nstarted feeling contractions at 3 am. She didn't wake me up until 6<br />\nam, since the contractions were weak and 20 minutes apart. We knew<br />\nthat things wouldn't be serious until they were 5 minutes apart or the<br />\nwater broke, so we weren't yet too concerned. We went ahead with our<br />\nChristmas dinner plans, roasted goose legs from Poland, with red<br />\ncabbage and potatoes. After all , the goose legs were already thawed<br />\nout, and had to be cooked that day.</p>\n<p>However, just as the goose legs came out of the oven, the water<br />\nbroke. It didn't come rushing out, though, and the contractions were<br />\nstill 15 minutes apart and fairly weak. My wife called her midwife, who<br />\nsaid not to be concerned yet as long as she was feeling well. We<br />\nwent ahead with dinner.</p>\n<p>However, after dinner, at 2:30 pm, the water started flowing more<br />\nstrongly, and my wife was not feeling good any longer. \"We are going to<br />\nthe hospital... NOW.\" So we did, and my mother-in-law had to find her<br />\nown way to the train station after all.</p>\n<p>It had started to snow (northern Germany was catching the edge of the<br />\nbig storm that caused so much damage in France), so driving to the<br />\nhospital was pretty slow. At the hospital, they attached a CTG (fetal<br />\nheart monitor) for 30 minutes (contractions now 8 minutes apart),<br />\nperformed an ultrasound, told us we had a ways to go yet and that the<br />\nsize of the baby could cause difficulties, and had us fill out<br />\npaperwork, move into a room, and come back in a couple of hours, at<br />\n7:30. Then it was back on the CTG. The contractions were now 5 minutes<br />\napart and getting uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>We then moved into a delivery prep area, where in theory my wife could<br />\nrelax and take a bath, which would make the contractions more<br />\ncomfortable. In fact, they became totally unbearable, in every<br />\nposition, and in the bath they felt worse. The cervix was only dilated<br />\n3 cm... it needs to be 10 cm to deliver, so things would only get<br />\nworse.</p>\n<p>We hadn't really discussed pain medication beforehand, except that<br />\nwe'd try to get by without if we could. Obviously, at this point all<br />\nbets were off, and she requested a PDA... anesthetic injected near<br />\nthe spinal cord, the strongest type of pain medication available for<br />\nnormal delivery.</p>\n<p>However, the PDA meant the birth became a very clinical procedure. It<br />\nwas applied by an anesthetist, an IV was needed to regulate blood<br />\npressure, a CGT was then permanently attached, and labor-inducing<br />\nmedication were administered to keep the contractions going. We even had<br />\nto sign a release between contractions, but by 11 pm the PDA was in<br />\nplace, and my wife was in peace. The PDA would last for 2 hours...</p>\n<p>In theory, anyway. In fact, the pains returned after only an<br />\nhour. Even worse, the anesthetist was no longer available to reapply<br />\nthe PDA (that snowstorm had caused a number of accidents)... only at<br />\n1:30 am did someone arrive to refill the anesthetic. If they hadn't<br />\narrived, a Cesarean section would have been unavoidable, as my wife had<br />\nno strength left at all, and her cervix was only at 8 cm.</p>\n<p>With the second PDA, though, she was able to even sleep for about<br />\nan hour and the cervix was able to dilate fully before she had to start pressing. However, the size of the baby was causing problems. The head was just too large to pass into the birth canal. The doctor was signalling that they could start a Cesarean, but the midwife insisted that my wife was making progress.</p>\n<p>The midwife was right. At 3:15, the head was far enough down so that a<br />\nvacuum extractor (an alternative to forceps commonly used in Europe)<br />\ncould be used to complete delivery. One doctor pounded on my wife's<br />\nstomach, the other pulled on the extractor, and at 3:39 am Christopher, all wet and sloppy, was laying on her stomach.</p>\n<p><em> This story from my old weblog was copied into Movable Type on 17 August 2003</em></p>"},{fields:{title:"Christopher Ryan Hanson",date:"29 Dec 1999",slug:"/1999-12-29-christopher-ryan-hanson/",tags:"Y1999"},html:'<p>For grandparents and other hardcore Christopher fans, we have set up photo albums (<a href="http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=938240102&n=2454059">Day 1</a> and <a href="http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=785480102&n=4898694">Day 2</a>) at Ofoto.com (they\'ll ask you to register first, and they only ship prints to US addresses)</p>\n<p>Now that we have a suitable subject, I\'m looking for the best way to share masses of digital photos.

We never got in the habit of using Skype; a cordless phone is just a lot handier than turning on the PC. For a while I had a US Skype Number with a Minnesota area code. However, at ‚Ç¨5 a month it\'s not that cheap, and worse, my parents were not able to reach the number from their cell phones. And if I forward the calls to our regular German number, I pay Skype rates for the privilege.</p>\n<p>So I did some hunting around, and discovered the VOIP provider <a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/default.asp">Anveo</a> offers US numbers pay-as-you-go for $2 a month (<a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/mainphonenumbers.asp">"Personal Unlimited"</a> plan). You can then forward the calls to a regular number at their normal rates, but since we have VOIP at home anyway, I just set them up as an additional account and pay nothing. Calls to the US cost $0.01 per minute, slightly cheaper than our main provider. They have servers in both the US and Germany. We\'ve been with them for 2 months, and they seem to work just fine.</p>\n<p>In case you\'re wondering, our main VOIP (for home and home office) is on <a href="http://www.sipgate.de/team/voip">Sipgate Team</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004U6NTXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B004U6NTXU&linkCode=as2&tag=papascott-21">Gigaset C610 IP</a><img src="//ir-de.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=papascott-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B004U6NTXU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> base station.

Network is ATT, and for the data plans <a href="http://goredpocket.com/plans#gsmt-mi">"tethering is encouraged"</a> (that was our mistake last year, no tethering, and we constantly fought over the one tablet with internet).
