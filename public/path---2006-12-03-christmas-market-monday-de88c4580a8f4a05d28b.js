I usually don\'t go along with special blogging days, but since we were meeting Oma at the Christmas Market in Buchholz anyway, I brought my camera along. Just to be a non-conformist, I\'m posting mine a day early. There\'s a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail7">set at flickr</a>, and a slideshow <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/show/">here</a>. I tried to tell a story with the captions, so maybe the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail/">plain view</a> is better than the slideshow (where you have to click on each picture to see the caption).</p>\n<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://static.flickr.com/116/313145816_1459e156c7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG 1827" /></a></p>\n<p>It would have been funnier to go to the <a href="http://www.hamburg.de/event.do?cid=6513353">"Santa Pauli" Christmas Market</a> on Spielbudenplatz, which features booths from FC St. Pauli and a various sex shops, since we were in the area on Friday. Actually not, since it was so blatantly commercial and was most definately inappropriate for children. We didn\'t stop.</p>',fields:{title:"Christmas Market Monday",date:"03 Dec 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-12-03-christmas-market-monday/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-12-03-christmas-market-monday/",prev:{fields:{title:"No Accident",date:"02 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-02-no-accident/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Do-It-Yourself Advent Calendar",date:"03 Dec 2006",slug:"/2006-12-03-do-it-yourself-advent-calendar/"}}}}}});
