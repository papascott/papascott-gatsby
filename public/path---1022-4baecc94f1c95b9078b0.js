Mama was putting out fires on the telephone, using both ISDN lines and my (not her) cell phone at the same time. (Her D1 cell phone from work has no reception in LÃ¼llau. She says that she hates my phone, but never hesitates to use it without asking.) Three cities (Hamburg, Hannover, Bremen), three problems, three telephones... but only two ears and one mouth. Windows died on my ThinkPad, so I was busy with the Recovery CD (and making sure it didn't touch the Linux partition). And Christopher was busy reorganizing those parts of the kitchen he could reach. By 9 pm we were all exhausted and in bed.</p>\n<p>With Mama back on board as the main wage earner, I had to change my tax exemption status back to that of the secondary earner <i>(Lohnsteuerklasse 5)</i>. My net pay is now 1/3 less than last year, and is just 45% of my gross pay. Last month Mama didn't even notice that it had been posted to our account!</p>\n<p>And then I have to put up with insults from my co-workers: 'Only in America does the pizza come to your door faster than an ambulance.' \";->\" And they expect me to bring treats to the office tomorrow?

No, it can't be her phone, Mama insisted, since she doesn't have any reception at home. She believed me the second time. I guess her reception at home is only spotty and not non-existant. </p>\n<p>She went right back to sleep, but I was wide awake with a spark of inspiration for the bug database I'm adapting for work. So here I am programming when I should be sleeping. </p>\n<p>We've got nearly 10 cm of snow and it's still coming down. I'm glad I have a Christopher day tomorrow.
