The weather was almost as nice in our backyard as in Florida. One thing I missed while I was gone was a new 4.x release of <a title=\"The FreeBSD Project\" href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\">FreeBSD</a>, so I opened up the ThinkPad on the patio and set about updating the BSD machine and the ThinkPad itself. Update source, build world, build kernel, install kernel, reboot, install world.</p>\n<p>Everything went smooth as silk, but a few minutes after booting up the ThinkPad, it starting beeping, quietly but consistently, every three minutes or so. Had I mistakenly turned on power management? A cosmetic flaw in my ThinkPad is that the battery doesn't charge. OK, that would be a fatal flaw for most users, but I only use the ThinkPad around the house and plugging in to an outlet isn't that big a deal. But power management would complain about a low battery.</p>\n<p>So I checked 'ps -ax', but no apmd is listed. I check /var/log/messages... nothing unusual there. The machine beeps again. I shut down X. I do a restart. The beeps continue. I turn the sound volune down to zero. I check the BIOS settings. The machine beeps again. Frustrated, I turn the whole thing off.</p>\n<p>The machine beeps again.</p>\n<p>Now that I have the screen folded down, I see that one of our cordless phone handsets is on the patio table. The battery is low, and it is beeping, quietly but consistently, every three minutes or so.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Backpedal in Place",date:"20 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-20-backpedal-in-place/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Good Morning Sunshine",date:"22 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-22-good-morning-sunshine/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Backpedal in Place",date:"20 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-20-backpedal-in-place/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p>Some blogs (<a title="BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_04.html#003598">BuzzMachine</a>, <a title="The Command Post - Iraq - German PM Schröder regrets words that hit U.S.-German ties" href="http://www.command-post.org/archives/005913.html">The Command Post</a>, <a title="USS Clueless - Schroeder apologizes" href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/04/Schroederapologizes.shtml">USS Clueless</a>) have cited a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/reuters20030419_155.html" title="Schroeder Regrets Words That Hit U.S.-German Ties">Reuters report</a> of a <a title="Kanzler: \'Dann lasst uns streiten!\' - DER SPIEGEL - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,245358,00.html">Spiegel interview</a>. The Reuters article reports that the interview "is the furthest Schroeder has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S.":</p>\n<blockquote><p>"I deeply regret there were exaggerated comments -- also from cabinet members of my previous government," Schroeder told Der Spiegel magazine when asked if there were "grounds for self-criticism" for damage he caused to U.S.-German relations.<br />\nThe declaration was the furthest Schroeder has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Except that Schröder\'s words were nothing new. He\'s been saying the same thing for weeks now. Note that he\'s not regretting anything that he said himself, only that there had been "exagertated comments"... also from the US, I presume. The German press is not reporting the interview as any change in foreign policy. Indeed, Spiegel has the interview filed under domestic news, as the main theme is Schröder\'s struggle with his own party over his economic reforms. The rest of the press isn\'t mentioning the article at all.</p>\n<p>Maybe Reuters\' man in Berlin should go out looking for real news instead of excerpting Spiegel articles.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"We're Back",date:"19 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-19-were-back/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Great Moments in Tech Support",date:"20 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-20-great-moments-in-tech-support/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:771,pageCount:1101}}}});
