I have a feeling this is not the kind of class where you want to catch up on your studies all at once (especially since MamaMaus is a beer drinker, therefore I have to study alone). As for the week one Bordeaux, the <a href="http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/579959.html?eid=580464">2005 Camarsac</a> is nice for under 10 Euros, but I don\'t smell the berries, and certainly not the cougar cage.</p>\n<p>Nice marketing gag... we usually don\'t read Stern but now we (or least I) will be reading every week until mid-June for sure.</p>',fields:{title:"Wine School",date:"16 Jan 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-01-16-wine-school/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-01-16-wine-school/",prev:{fields:{title:"Wii Don't",date:"16 Jan 2007",slug:"/2007-01-16-wii-dont/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Stormy Weather",date:"17 Jan 2007",slug:"/2007-01-17-stormy-weather/"}}}}}});
