After being <a href=\"/2002/01/23/115.php\">stalled for over a year</a>, the case was tossed out on a rather significant technicality, namely that at least 30 of the party's 200 national and state leaders were paid police informants. It was thus impossible to for the court determine how much of the party's activities were instigated by informers for the government. </p>\n<p>Interior Minister Schilly and the state ministries are pinning the blame on each other. In the end, the various ministries didn't know about the other's informants. Federalism doesn't work if you don't talk to one another.

They interviewed several German students in rural America who have met hostility to Germany\'s and their own personal anti-war beliefs. Back in 1980 Mama was branded as a \'Pinko Commie\' by her high school classmates, and I think she still has the T-shirt they gave her to prove it. And she was reminded about Nazis as well. </p>\n<p>As an exchange student, your mission is not to teach about your home country, but to listen and learn, about your guest country, and, more importantly, about yourself. The political situation and the media frenzy around it make the situation more tense than we had to deal with 20 years ago, but there are assholes to deal with in any situation. Especially when Europe and the US seem to be drifting apart, the experiences of exchange students are more important than ever. Finding a spouse at the same time is a side benefit reserved for a select few.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Testing One Two Three",date:"16 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-16-testing-one-two-three/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"NDP Not Outlawed",date:"18 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-18-ndp-not-outlawed/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Testing One Two Three",date:"16 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-16-testing-one-two-three/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="blogrolling.com - members home" href="http://www.blogrolling.com/">blogrolling.com</a> is now accepting pings, so I had to change my blogroll code not to always overwrite the update time with that from blo.gs.
