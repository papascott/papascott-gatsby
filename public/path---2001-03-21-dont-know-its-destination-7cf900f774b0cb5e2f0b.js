State elections (coming up this weekend) seem to bring out the worst in German politicians, whether it's a petition against dual-citizenship, a 'Kinder staat Inder' (children not Indians) campaign against the green card, or now a silly debate whether it's OK to say that one is proud to be German. It seems especially silly to me, being born in a country where patriotism is, well, as American as apple pie. It's fun listening to CDU politicians whine, though. Helmut Kohl never had such a thin skin. Kohl was never thin, period.</p>\n<p>Ich mu√ü Harald Schmidt zustimmen: lieber stolz, ein Deutscher zu sein, als stolz, Laurenz Meyer zu sein!</p>",fields:{title:"Don't Know Its Destination",date:"21 Mar 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-03-21-dont-know-its-destination/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-03-21-dont-know-its-destination/",prev:{fields:{title:"Madman Situation",date:"20 Mar 2001",slug:"/2001-03-20-madman-situation/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Skipping School",date:"23 Mar 2001",slug:"/2001-03-23-skipping-school/"}}}}}});
