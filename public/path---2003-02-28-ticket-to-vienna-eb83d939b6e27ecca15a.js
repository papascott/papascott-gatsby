I was heartened to see that <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">JÃ¶rg Kantel</a> submitted <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2003/02/28.html#00577">"a bunch of unconnected notes"</a>, which I bet I can match in unconnectedness. (Then again he\'s a keynote speaker, and I was just invited to make a proposal.) I did manage to quote a line from <a title="Lost in time, and lost in space, and meaning" href="http://www.rockyhorror.com/">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>, and I\'m not sure if I should do the whole thing in a Rocky Horror theme, or just include random film quotes (the scorpion line from Lawrence of Arabia <a title="Thy mother mated with a scorpion!" href="http://vowe.net/archives/003043.html">mentioned today</a> on vowe.net would be fitting as well). But I guess the proposal has to be accepted first.</p>',fields:{title:"Ticket To Vienna",date:"28 Feb 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-02-28-ticket-to-vienna/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-02-28-ticket-to-vienna/",prev:{fields:{title:"You're So Vain",date:"26 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-26-youre-so-vain/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Time Shift",date:"28 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-28-time-shift/"}}}}}});
