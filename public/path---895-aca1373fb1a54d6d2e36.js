They were not communicated in one-to-one meetings, as one would expect, but instead dropped anonymously into the employees' home mailboxes on Friday afternoon. And this is supposed to motivate us remaining employees to pull ourselves out of the crisis? Hardly. Stay-at-home fatherhood is looking better all the time. The mood is miserable.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Fahrrad!",date:"20 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-20-fahrrad/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Is Everyone Watching TV?

My dept was also hit; my office mate, a Sr Systems Manager who has been with the company since it was founded, was among those let go.</p>\n<p>This came totally out of the blue. This week we had announced a new customer and 1st quarter numbers (a slight loss). I don't know whether this is the beginning of the death spiral for the company, or if management just decided to get rid of some people they don't like. Neither possibility is pleasant to think about, and Tuesday (Monday is a holiday) will be an interesting work day, I'm sure.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Would It Have Made A Difference?",date:"17 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-17-would-it-have-made-a-difference/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Fahrrad!",date:"20 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-20-fahrrad/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:895,pageCount:1101}}}});
