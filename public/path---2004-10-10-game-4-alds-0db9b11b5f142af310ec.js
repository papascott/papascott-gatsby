As an afternoon game, it started at 10:30 pm German time, and I thought it might be my last chance to see Johan Santana pitch this year. Turned out I was right. Santana wasn't at his best, having had only 3 days rest, but had a few great moments. I didn't make it until the end, though. I went to bed at 2:30, after 10 innings, so I didn't see the bitter end. Sierra's tying home run in the 8th was bitter enough.</p>",fields:{title:"Game 4 ALDS",date:"10 Oct 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-10-10-game-4-alds/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-10-10-game-4-alds/",prev:{fields:{title:"Game 3 ALDS",date:"09 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-09-game-3-alds/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Coconut",date:"12 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-12-coconut/"}}}}}});
