The list looks like enough for a dozen lifetimes to me. Funny things is, in a bi-national family we have <i>less</i> opportunity to see places than we would otherwise, since our resources we have for travelling (mainly time, but also money) are spent visiting family and relatives. My parents have seen more of Europe than I have, and Mama\'s brothers have seen more of the US than Mama has. So it goes. But at least I have one place on both <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Andrea</a> and <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/">Susan</a>, namely <a href="http://www.ipanema.com/">Rio de Janeiro</a>.
