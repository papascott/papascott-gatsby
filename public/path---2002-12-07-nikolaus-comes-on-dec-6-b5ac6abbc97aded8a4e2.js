We forgot all about it, so we had no boots out for Christopher. We tried to make up for it by opening up one of his presents last evening, a double-decker train station for his wooden set. </p>\n<p>Have I mentioned that all of his presents this year will come from E-Bay? Does that make us evil parents? </p>\n<p>Also of note: Christopher used the toilet at home for the first time yesterday! That's no great accomplishment for him, he's been practicing at day care for over a week. It is an milestone for his parents, who finally got him to the bathroom in time. Yes, parents need toilet training, too.</p>",fields:{title:"Nikolaus comes on Dec 6",date:"07 Dec 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-12-07-nikolaus-comes-on-dec-6/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-12-07-nikolaus-comes-on-dec-6/",prev:{fields:{title:"3x365",date:"05 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-05-3x365/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Party Like It's 1968",date:"07 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-07-party-like-its-1968/"}}}}}});
