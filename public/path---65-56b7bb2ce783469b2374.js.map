This is not so much about what we saw as about how we got there, and almost didn't get back...</em></p>\\n<p>One thing about becoming a settled expat is that you are not able to be see as much of your new country and continent as you might think. Yes, in Germany we get 6 weeks vacation per year, but most of that is used either to visit friends and family on the old continent or to show visitors from the old continent things you've already seen yourself. My parents saw more of Europe on a 3-week bus tour than I've seen in 18 years living here.</p>\\n<p>Our only true European adventure was back in 1996. We had just signed<br />\\nthe contract to buy a house, and figured (rightly, as it turned out)<br />\\nthat our time and money would be severely strained for the next couple<br />\\nof year. If we wanted to take a proper vacation, we had to do it now.<br />\\nBut since we had just put most of our savings into the down payment,<br />\\ncost was a major issue. So we decided to do a Eastern European camping<br />\\ntrip.</p>\\n<p>My wife had a business conference in Prague that June, and we used<br />\\nthat as our jumping-off point. She had a decent company car, but<br />\\nwasn't allowed to drive it the the \\\"New East\\\", so I drove to Prague in<br />\\nmy Renault R5 (similar to a Volkswagen Golf, except French and less<br />\\nreliable... in fact it died for good a year later). Loaded down with 2<br />\\nbicycles and a hatch full of camping equipment, I pulled up to the<br />\\nPrague Hilton and spirited my wife away. Still in her business<br />\\nclothes, she was brought to our tent at a campground literally on the<br />\\nwrong side of the tracks. The next few days we were then able to take<br />\\na closer look at the sights that she'd had only seen from the tour<br />\\nbus.</p>\\n<p>Our next stop was Lake Balaton in Hungary, which wasn't quite what we<br />\\nimagined (too shallow and muddy). \\\"I want to swim in the blue ocean on<br />\\nmy birthday,\\\" said my wife, and pointed to Istria on the map, just a<br />\\nhop, skip and a jump through Croatia away. The map was, however<br />\\ndeceiving. What looked like 3 hours actually took 10. For one thing I<br />\\nhad to wait over an hour at the border for a Croatian visa (lesson for<br />\\nspontaneous travel decisions... check visa requirements). In addition,<br />\\nthe road from the border to Zagreb wasn't exactly paved, and the<br />\\nmotorway from Zagreb to the coast wasn't yet exactly complete, so we<br />\\nspent hours snaking through the hills under half-finished bridges. But<br />\\nwe arrived at a wonderful campground on the coast with hundreds of<br />\\nspaces, but only 10% occupied since the war had only been over for a<br />\\nyear.</p>\\n<p>Now that we knew about the bad roads, we decided to return to Hungary<br />\\nvia Slovenia and Austria for our last stop in Budapest. We found a<br />\\nbeautiful campground on a wooded hill overlooking the city. It was<br />\\ngreat in the morning to coast with our bikes down to the river. It was<br />\\nnot so much fun evenings to trudge with our bikes uphill.</p>\\n<p>All in all, bikes are a great way to explore a new city, and we'd<br />\\ncertainly do it again, but without the R5 and without the tent. Last<br />\\nyear we took a bike tour of Barcelona and loved it (except for the<br />\\nroad up the mountain to the Citadel). Between the sights you have the<br />\\nchance to see the city from street level and get a feel for its pulse.</p>\\n<p>But even today I shudder to think... what if our R5 had broken down on<br />\\nthat dirt road in Croatia.
