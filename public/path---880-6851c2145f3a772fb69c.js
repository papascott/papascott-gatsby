Well, at least my non-Windows wireless connectivity. Since running FreeBSD on my desktop machine has been going so well, I decided to put it on my ThinkPad 390X notebook as well. I wiped out the Debian partitions, not taking note of the wireless settings  it took me <a href=\"/2002/06/22\">several days</a> to work out last summer.  After all, FreeBSD has wireless built in. That was on Thursday. I still haven't worked out how to get the wireless card going. According to ifconfig and wicontrol, everything should be set up properly, but when I ping, the connection lights sputter a couple of times instead of blinking madly as they should. Oh well, with Mozilla and putty under Win98 I can do most of what I need to do, and the sun is too bright to work outside anyway.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Hey Shrek! Tag Me!

There are days when one of the halves just isn't up to it, and the other half can take over. There are nights when you just can't just wash his face, brush his teeth, and put him in bed. You have to let him wash your face with his wet washcloth (as well as your hair, your ears, your chest, and whatever else he can reach), put toothpaste on his brush 3 times and let him use 3 cups of water to rinse his mouth, and read Winnie The Pooh, The Farm Book, and The Hungry Little Caterpillar before he even thinks of lying down. That's just how it goes. After all, Mom took him to a charity summer party and to watch trains at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. I guess I can spend a hour with him to wind him down.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Eisenbahn Man",date:"23 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-23-eisenbahn-man/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"If It Ain't Broke, Go And Break It",date:"23 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-23-if-it-aint-broke-go-and-break-it/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Eisenbahn Man",date:"23 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-23-eisenbahn-man/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p><img alt="crh23062002.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/06/crh23062002.jpg" width="350" height="262" border="0" /></p>\n<p>Christopher Ryan, hero of the wooden railroad!</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Get Out and Stay Out!",date:"22 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-22-get-out-and-stay-out/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Hey Shrek!
