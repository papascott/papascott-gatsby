In the UK, half the executive team started on the shop floor and 25 per cent are women.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(via <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,472681,00.html">Spiegel Online</a>)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Samsung Q35 Red",date:"19 Mar 2007",slug:"/2007-03-19-samsung-q35-red/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Bricks and Mortar",date:"27 Mar 2007",slug:"/2007-03-27-bricks-and-mortar/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Samsung Q35 Red",date:"19 Mar 2007",slug:"/2007-03-19-samsung-q35-red/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/q35-red.gif" alt="Q35 red" /></p>\n<p>We\'re looking at a new notebook for MamaMaus.
