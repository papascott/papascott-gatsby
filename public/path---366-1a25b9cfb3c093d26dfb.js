We don\'t have an FCC in Germany, but we do have the <em>Bild Zeitung</em> to watch over morals in the media and society... and we have <a href="http://www.bildblog.de/">BildBlog</a> to watch over the <em>Bild Zeiting</em>. Lately, <em>Bild</em> has compained that <a title="BILDblog - Bild sprach zuerst mitÂ… dem Friseur" href="http://www.bildblog.de/index.php?p=332">a gay politician kissed a woman in public</a> ("Is he no longer gay?"), that <a title="BILDblog - Routine" href="http://www.bildblog.de/index.php?p=378">a TV nude scene was cut</a> from a mini-series ("Is she not pretty enough for TV?"), and that Germany\'s most respected <a title="BILDblog - Christiansen und der Hundesalon" href="http://www.bildblog.de/index.php?p=377">newscaster opened a dog salon</a> ("Massages for rich Fifis"). So our morals in Germany are safe, thanks to <em>Bild</em>. (And thanks to BildBlog, we can know what\'s in the <em>Bild Zeitung</em> without actually have to read it ourselves.)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Expatriate Hipsters",date:"13 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-13-expatriate-hipsters/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Was Kerry poisoned?",date:"13 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-13-was-kerry-poisoned/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Expatriate Hipsters",date:"13 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-13-expatriate-hipsters/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="U.S. Expatriate Hipsters Plug Into the Buzz of Berlin" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-expats12dec12,0,60127.story?coll=la-home-world">LA Times: U.S. Expatriate Hipsters Plug Into the Buzz of Berlin</a> "Berlin is like the antidote to New York.
