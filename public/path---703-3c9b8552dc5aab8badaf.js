In the East, of course, since it showed that the East German state had no standing without Soviet tanks to back it up, and in the West, since it showed that it lacked the ability, the will, and the courage to roll back the Iron Curtain. As the tanks opened fire, the protesters were on their own, just as they would be later in Budapest, in Prague, and in Gdansk. JFK and Ronald Reagan would shake their fists at the Wall, but could do little else.</p>\n<p>I can\'t help but think that today, as some in the US  are making plans to bring peace and democracy to Iraq and the entire Middle East, whether they again are making promises that they will not have the ability, the will, and the courage to fulfill.</p>\n<p><b>Update</b> Here are the Quick Links I collected on the uprising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title="The people in the GDR withdrew its trust in the government" href="http://www.volksaufstand1953.de/english/english.html">June 17th, 1953 - Personal memories of the strike leader Karl-Heinz Pahling</a></li>\n<li><a title="divided East Germans into those who could live with the regime and those who could stand it no longer" href="http://www.heise.de/tp/english/kolumnen/hud/15008/1.html">What We Think About When We Think About Germany</a></li>\n<li><a title=" 60 to 80 civilians were killed during the uprisings, although the definite numbers were never verified" href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=%7BF1B72E86-3783-11D4-A3AA-009027BA22E4%7D&amp;doc=%7BDEDC99E1-268F-48C4-8DE4-A0D8A5ECDDCF%7D">The day Germans took to the streets</a></li>\n<li><a title="50 deaths, hundreds of injuries and thousands of arrests and prison sentences" href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1432_A_894998_1_A,00.html">East Berlin June 17, 1953: Stones Against Tanks</a></li>\n<li><a title="and the West stood by and did nothing, just like in 1956, 1961, 1968..." href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,4789_W_895692,00.html">50th anniversary of GDR uprising</a></li>\n</ul>'},next:{fields:{title:"Linux ist pleite",date:"16 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-16-linux-ist-pleite/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"50th anniversary of GDR uprising",date:"17 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-17-50th-anniversary-of-gdr-uprising/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Linux ist pleite",date:"16 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-16-linux-ist-pleite/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><a title="Linux is bankrupt, but Microsoft has shown interest in acquiring the remaining assets" href="http://www.linux-ist-pleite.de/heise.php">Linux ist pleite</a> (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.linux-ist-pleite.de%2Fheise.php&amp;langpair=de%7Cen">translation</a>)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Garton Ash on Europe and America",date:"16 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-16-garton-ash-on-europe-and-america/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"1953: Workers' Uprising in East Berlin",date:"17 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-17-1953-workers-uprising-in-east-berlin/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:703,pageCount:1101}}}});
