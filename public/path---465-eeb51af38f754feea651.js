My great-uncle who told the story has since passed away, and among his effects was a newspaper article about <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/bios/aarvik.html">Egil Aarvig</a> (1912-1990), Norwegian politician, newspaper editor and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. My grandmother\'s maiden name was Aakvik, so it could very well be that we are related to the late Norwegian politician.

I have one (un, eins, uno) point, and it took a herioc effort by Zidane to achieve that. Yesterday, for example, I picked Italy to win and Sweden to tie. Today I\'ve picked the Czechs and Holland to win, so things are looking good for a couple of upsets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=323">Nico</a> is complaining about the announcing talents of Reinhold Beckmann.
