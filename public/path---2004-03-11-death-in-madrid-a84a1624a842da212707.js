At the same time in Madrid, <a title="Spain Struggles to Absorb Worst Terrorist Attack in Its History" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/international/europe/11CND-TRAI.html?ex=1394427600&en=ff54915075ac4ed3&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">190 commuters in Madrid</a> were killed by at least 10 explosions at 3 commuter stations. I can only think of the words from the memorial service for the victims of 9/11. To paraphrase for todays events... this was not 190 people being killed, it was 1 person being killed, 1 person with home, family, friends, 1 person being killed.... 190 times.</p>\n<p>While I realize that it is necessary to find those responsible, be they from the ETA or al Qaeda, but on the other hand I find the speculation on which group is responsible to be somewhat cynical. Does it really matter to the victims for which supposed cause they were killed? Doesn\'t the attention given to the perpetrators and their motives give them a false legitimacy and encourage similar attacks in the future? At this moment, I would rather think of the father and husband who, unlike me, was not able to step off the train and onto the platform at 7:40 this morning, than about the twisted reasoning and motives of those who killed him.</p>',fields:{title:"Death in Madrid",date:"11 Mar 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-03-11-death-in-madrid/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-03-11-death-in-madrid/",prev:{fields:{title:"",date:"10 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-10-koehler-fuer-deutschland/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Lyssa has moved",date:"12 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-12-lyssa-has-moved/"}}}}}});
