The idea was so wild we just had to say yes... a pulling contest for remote-controlled models (1:5/1:6) featuring a 60 cm replica of a Big Mac with up to 22 kg. The <a href="http://www.bigmac-pulling.de/">Big Mac Pulling</a> will take place on Sunday, September 30, 9:00 to 18:00. Buchholz has Sunday shopping on that day as well, so those not interested in cars and dirt will have something to do as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.bigmac-pulling.de/"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/big-mac-pulling-flyer.jpg" alt="Big Mac Pulling Fyer" /></a></p>',fields:{title:"Big Mac Pulling",date:"31 Aug 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-08-31-big-mac-pulling/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-08-31-big-mac-pulling/",prev:{fields:{title:"Baby A",date:"25 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-25-baby-a/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Christopher's Homemade Berliner",date:"31 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-31-christophers-homemade-berliner/"}}}}}});
