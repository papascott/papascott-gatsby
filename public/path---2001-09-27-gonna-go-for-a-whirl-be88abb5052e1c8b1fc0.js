We Americans remember that war somewhat differently. Studs Terkel wrote an oral history of World War II entitled "The Good War", which I haven\'t read, but the title relects our thoughts quite well. It was a monumental task, but we got it done.</p>\n<p>We use the word "war" quite often to mean a monumental task. The war on crime. The war on drugs. German doesn\'t seem to use "Krieg" in this way. Then there is the American phrase "moral equivalent of war". There\'s no German equivalent, I don\'t think, no phrase for "moral equivalent of the worst possible moral outcome". So when American speak of a new "war", it could very well be misunderstood.</p>',fields:{title:"Gonna Go For A Whirl",date:"27 Sep 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-09-27-gonna-go-for-a-whirl/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-09-27-gonna-go-for-a-whirl/",prev:{fields:{title:"Headbanger",date:"26 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-26-headbanger/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Can't Stop",date:"28 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-28-cant-stop/"}}}}}});
