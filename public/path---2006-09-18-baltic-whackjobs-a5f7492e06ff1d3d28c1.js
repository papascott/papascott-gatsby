As always when the far-right does well in an election, there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the German media. Doug Merrill at A Fistful of Euros is <a href="http://fistfulofeuros.net/archives/002683.php" title="Sandy Brown Baltic Shores">not quite so hysterical</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  On the whole, though, Id be cautiously optimistic... in a state with 18 percent unemployment, the extremist vote was below 10 percent. ... the far right has ebbed and flowed throughout the postwar period, and its never gotten anywhere close to a share of power at the national level... (finally) the far right tends to fractiousness, as the disintegration of the NPD parliamentary party in Saxony in late 2005 most recently showed.</p>\n<p>  One in 14 voters in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is willing to cast a ballot for right-wing whackjobs. That, for better or for worse, is probably not too far from the European norm.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Neo-Nazis aren\'t interested in politics, they just like the sound of their own voice. I\'d be more worried about the low turnout (59.2%), which means a good share of the voters aren\'t interested in politics either.</p>',fields:{title:"Baltic Whackjobs",date:"18 Sep 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-09-18-baltic-whackjobs/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-09-18-baltic-whackjobs/",prev:{fields:{title:"How to keep your cell phone from disrupting family time",date:"16 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-16-how-to-keep-your-cell-phone-from-disrupting-family-time/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Stutter Group",date:"21 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-21-stutter-group/"}}}}}});
