This was confirmed in the OpenBC blog after a couple of webloggers found the name in <a href="http://www.chuchichaeschtli.com/artikel/heisst-openbc-bald-xing">domain and trademark searches</a>. The goal was to have a domain more meaningful in Asia and English-speaking markets. OpenBC wasn\'t real clear, it sounds like a group of Old Testament historians.</p>\n<p>Xing might be a good fit in Chinese (it means "I can do it", so I hear), but I don\'t think it works as well in English as they think. They are thinking of "crossing" as on traffic signs (Ped Xing, RR Xing). I don\'t think the abbreviation is used outside of the US. And used by itself, the association with crossing is unclear, particularly if you pronounce it as "Zing". Even if one does think of a "crossing", I don\'t think the panic of one about to be blindsided by a train is the emotion they are trying to evoke.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it could have been worse. They could have chosen "Xingr".</p>\n<p>(Note to self: should I ever be looking for a full-time local employer in the future, OpenBC, er, Xing sounds like a cool place to work.)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Playground at Planten un Blomen",date:"24 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-24-playground-at-planten-un-blomen/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Water Slide",date:"26 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-26-water-slide/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Playground at Planten un Blomen",date:"24 Sep 2006",slug:"/2006-09-24-playground-at-planten-un-blomen/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/251195634/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://static.flickr.com/111/251195634_811a8ccbdb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="24092006064" /></a></p>\n<p>MamaMaus had to work today, but she took us along to Hamburg so we could go watch <a href="http://hamburg-freezers.de/">ice hockey</a>.
