No, noone I know is getting married.

So we get to go to Berlin and watch millionaires spend money. </p>\n<p>Our first attempt in Hamburg yesterday was a failure, as the shop was too small and didn't do alterations, which left us both in a sour mood. Last night I searched Google and found <a href=\"http://www.guenstige-brautkleider.de/\" title=\"Brautmoden Haupt in Hamburg\">Brautmoden Haupt in Hamburg Barmbek</a>. Frau Haupt had my size, was willing to cut several centimeters from the arms and legs, and had me set up in a half an hour. </p>\n<p>This adventure of the tuxedo is going to cost me in all 4 trips into the city (the failed trip yesterday, the successful trip today, the pick-up on Thursday, and the return next Monday), but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to make my wife look good.
