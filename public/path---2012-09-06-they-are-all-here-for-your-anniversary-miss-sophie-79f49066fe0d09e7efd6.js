We can still quote the <s>English</s> <s>German</s> (whatever) TV classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_for_One">"Dinner for One"</a> to one another: "You look younger than ever, love! Younger than ever!" Of course, the line may wear out someday. If someday this blog ceases to be updated and you hear about a particularly gory family drama* from northern Germany, you\'ll know I tried the line once too often.</p>\n<p>*Family drama (<em>Familiendrama</em>) is one of those phrases that in German means something completely different than in English. For us it might mean a TV show suitable to watch with your kids, or perhaps the "discussion" that ensues when a teenaged daughter tells her parents that she is pregnant. In German it refers to a murder (often a murder/suicide) within a family.</p>',fields:{title:"They are all here for your anniversary, Miss Sophie",date:"06 Sep 2012",url:"https://papascott.de/2012-09-06-they-are-all-here-for-your-anniversary-miss-sophie/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2012-09-06-they-are-all-here-for-your-anniversary-miss-sophie/",prev:{fields:{title:"Travel Blog",date:"16 Aug 2012",slug:"/2012-08-16-travel-blog/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Antalya and London",date:"08 Oct 2012",slug:"/2012-10-08-antalya-and-london/"}}}}}});
