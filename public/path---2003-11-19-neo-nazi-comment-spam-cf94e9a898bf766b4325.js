My latest post on <a title="PapaScott: Hohmann Go Home" href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/11/2694.php">Martin Hohmann</a> attracted a generic comment linking to a neo-Nazi news site. I\'ve removed the links, and closed discussion on that post, but I\'ve left the comment and the URLs for the sake of discussion. The comment <em>is</em> vaguely on-topic (as the post is on anti-semitism), and even neo-Nazis have the right to free speech. But on my blog?</p>\n<p><b>Update</b> Actually, since PapaScott is hosted with a German domain on a German host, and is therefore subject to German law,  neo-Nazis do <em>not</em> have a right to free speech on my blog.</p>',fields:{title:"Neo-Nazi Comment Spam",date:"19 Nov 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-11-19-neo-nazi-comment-spam/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-11-19-neo-nazi-comment-spam/",prev:{fields:{title:"Fear of Cows",date:"17 Nov 2003",slug:"/2003-11-17-fear-of-cows/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Plastic Pallet",date:"20 Nov 2003",slug:"/2003-11-20-plastic-pallet/"}}}}}});
