This would be a second honeymoon, except that we never really had a first honeymoon. Our first thought was Rome, and checking the prices and the flight schedules it looks very good. Now, I've never been to Italy at all, and Mama only once to Verona, so I'll ask my readers. What's essential to see and do (and eat and drink) in Rome for if one is there for 48 hours? No rental car, and no hangovers, please.</p>",fields:{title:"All roads lead...",date:"13 Jul 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-07-13-all-roads-lead/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-07-13-all-roads-lead/",prev:{fields:{title:"Sebrenica",date:"11 Jul 2003",slug:"/2003-07-11-sebrenica/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Don Park: Blogs will fade away",date:"13 Jul 2003",slug:"/2003-07-13-don-park-blogs-will-fade-away/"}}}}}});
