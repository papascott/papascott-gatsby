Like Christmas and Easter it comes <a href="/2000/05/14/">every</a> year (although last year I seem not to have mentioned it), and doesn\'t really change at all (except that this year it is in Estonia, which is somewhat unique). Some people take it seriously, but most don\'t. The German entry this year is supposed to be quite good (according to British bookmakers), but what chance does Germany have to win a European-wide phone-in popularity contest, no matter what the field?</p>\n<p><b>Results:</b> My taste must be becoming European. My two favorites, Malta and Latvia, finished second and first. The German performance was quite flat, and finished near the bottom.</p>',fields:{title:"Grand Prix Night",date:"25 May 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-05-25-grand-prix-night/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-05-25-grand-prix-night/",prev:{fields:{title:"Du bist kein Berliner!",date:"24 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-24-du-bist-kein-berliner/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Happy Region Code Day",date:"26 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-26-happy-region-code-day/"}}}}}});
