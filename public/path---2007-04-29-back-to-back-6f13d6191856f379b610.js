I\'ve been pain-free since the beginning of March, although I do feel some tension or tiredness in my lower back from time to time. I\'ve been going to a physiotherapist (my next-door neighbor), and she\'s been teaching me the basics... how to sit, how to stand, last week I tried walking.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.dr-wolff.com/"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dr-wolff-back-training.jpg" alt="Dr Wolff Back Training" title="Dr Wolff" align="right" /></a> Last week I started a 8-week training course at a local fitness studio. They have a set of machines from <a href="http://www.dr-wolff.com/">Dr. Wolff</a> to train the upper and lower back. The cost is covered by health insurance, and since we are supposed to work out on our own between sessions, it works out like a trial membership.</p>\n<p>The best part is that since the initial injection at the beginning of January, I\'ve taken absolutely no pain medication. I no longer have the TENS device (it was more a nuisance than a help), and I\'m not taking any more chiropractic treatments.</p>\n<p>My therapist (er, my neighbor) would like me to ergonomically optimize my workplace. Since I\'m about to switch jobs, I\'m not sure where my new workplace is going to be. I guess I\'ll have to work that out with my new boss.</p>',fields:{title:"Back to Back",date:"29 Apr 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-04-29-back-to-back/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-04-29-back-to-back/",prev:{fields:{title:"Bridge Days",date:"28 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-28-bridge-days/"}},next:{fields:{title:"McDonald's on Sabine Christiansen Tonight",date:"29 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-29-mcdonalds-on-sabine-christiansen-tonight/"}}}}}});
