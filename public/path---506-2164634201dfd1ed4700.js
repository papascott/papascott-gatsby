It will be good for the competition as well.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"The Spinger Telegraph?",date:"21 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-21-the-spinger-telegraph/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Gone Fishing",date:"23 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-23-gone-fishing/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"The Spinger Telegraph?",date:"21 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-21-the-spinger-telegraph/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>Spiegel Online is reporting that Germany\'s Springer Verlag, Europe\'s largest newspaper publisher (Bild, Die Welt) <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,291711,00.html" title="Pressebericht: Springer-Konzern will f端r Daily Telegraph bieten - Wirtschaft - SPIEGEL ONLINE">will make an offer</a> to buy the Daily Telegraph, Great Britain\'s largest non-tabloid paper.

It\'s designed to leave the plain text very readable after it\'s marked up, as opposed to <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/" title="by Dean Allen">Textile</a>, which makes marking up plain text easy but is leaves the plain text less than readable. Markdown might come in handy for text maintained by less web-savvy colleagues, or for quickly marking up text from web-unfriendly sources (like Microsoft Word). I\'ll try it out for a few posts.</p>\n<p>(The MTEntry tag <code>convert_breaks</code> seems to be incompatible with Markdown.
