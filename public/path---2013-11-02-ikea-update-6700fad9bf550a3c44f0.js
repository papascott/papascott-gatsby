In case it wasn\'t clear from the original post, my main objection to the first trip was that it was on a Saturday when the roads and the store would be completely full. My wife is redesigning our bathroom, and it was important to her that she show me the items in person at the store so I would feel involved in the decision.</p>\n<p>However, our purchasing using the self-service registers was an utter failure. Of our 14 items, we managed to leave 2 items unscanned at the table. I swear I spent and hour looking for our new blinds until I realized that they weren\'t on our receipt and they never made it out of the store.</p>',fields:{title:"Ikea Update",date:"02 Nov 2013",url:"https://papascott.de/2013-11-02-ikea-update/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2013-11-02-ikea-update/",prev:{fields:{title:"Ikea",date:"26 Oct 2013",slug:"/2013-10-26-ikea/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Happy New Year 2014",date:"31 Dec 2013",slug:"/2013-12-31-happy-new-year-2014/"}}}}}});
