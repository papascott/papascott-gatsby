I\'ll ask <a href="http://live.curry.com">Adam</a> if he thinks the stories there are any good. </p>\n<p>I\'m also surprised not to have seen any comparisons of Fortuyn with Germany\'s political maverick, Hamburg\'s Interior Senator "Judge Merciless" Ronald Schill. They have a number of surface similarities: both are celebrities new to politics, right of center without being radical right, founding parties that bear their names. However, Schill\'s celebrity is local to Hamburg, and his law-and-order platform is tailored for urban voters. Although his party pulled 4% in Sachsen-Anhalt last month, he doesn\'t have national ambitions, at least not for this year (he\'s supporting Stoiber). And Schill is nowhere near as charismatic as Fortuyn.</p>\n<p>(The <a href="http://www.schill-partei.de/">Schill Party website</a> is in German only, but it does have a picture of the good judge, and you can decide for yourself whether he would look any better with a Pim Fortuyn haircut.)</p>',fields:{title:"Dutch Elections, Fortuyn and Schill",date:"13 May 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-05-13-dutch-elections-fortuyn-and-schill/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-05-13-dutch-elections-fortuyn-and-schill/",prev:{fields:{title:"In Front Of The Paris",date:"12 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-12-in-front-of-the-paris/"}},next:{fields:{title:"IQ Haiku",date:"13 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-13-iq-haiku/"}}}}}});
