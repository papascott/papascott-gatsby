Not to be confused with the Autobahn Elbtunnel, the toll tunnel runs 0,426 km and connects the Landungsbr√ºcken with the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard on the island of Steinwerder. The tunnel was built in 1911 and is an engineering marvel even today. Elevators at each side lower vehicles into the narrow tunnel. Howver, traffic is down 50% since 1995. and tolls cover only a fraction of the cost of personnel (as the elevators are not automated) and maintenance. </p>\n<p>The tunnel is a tourist landmark, and we make sure we show it to our visitors. On weekends the tunnel is often closed for cultural event. like art shows, film festivals and <a href="http://www.photoloader.com/events/elbtunnel.asp">even</a> a <a href="http://elbtunnelmarathon.de/">marathon</a> (48 laps). If you remember the movie <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0071935">The Odessa File</a> with Jon Voight, the tunnel chase scene was filmed there.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Creative Track Laying",date:"09 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-09-creative-track-laying/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Big Bagger!",date:"10 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-10-big-bagger/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Creative Track Laying",date:"09 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-09-creative-track-laying/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>The Nikon repair shop cleverly sent an estimate at the upper limit of what we were willing to pay to have our CoolPix fix, so we accepted it and the camera will be ready... sometime.
