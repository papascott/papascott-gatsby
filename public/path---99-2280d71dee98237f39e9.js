Our McDrive is open until 4 am on weekends, and we made the decision not to stay open an extra hour for the time change.</p>\n<p>I had night shift that night, and I closed at 4 am DST as planned. Twenty minutes later a very angry guest pounded on our drive-thru window. It was 3:20, we should be open, and why wouldn\'t we serve him?</p>\n<p>As is often the case with arrogant Germans, technically he was correct. Standard Time was in effect, the time was 3:20 am. However, it\'s my business and I can open and close the doors when I damn well please. I shouted politely but firmly through the closed window that we were closed, and that if he did not leave the premises in 5 minutes I would call the cops.</p>\n<p>The angry guest then left. Being a know-it-all German means that you can often be smug about being correct, but it usually doesn\'t make things any better. He was still hungry.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"What If You Get Stopped?",date:"07 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-07-what-if-you-get-stopped/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Best. Online. Shop.

At 5 am, I'm lucky to remember anything on my way out. Unfortunately, I didn't notice my wallet was missing until after work and I had just filled my tank at the Aral gas station across the street from the restaurant.</p>\n<p>The only thing I had of value to leave as a deposit was my car registration. The woman behind the counter didn't want to take it at first... what if I got stopped by the police, I would need my registration. I talked her into it, as I had nothing else to offer, and she let me return 30 minutes later with EC card to pay for my diesel.</p>\n<p>Her concern was typically German and actually pretty silly. If I would really have been stopped, having a stolen tank of gas and no driver's license would have interested the police much more the missing registration. :-)</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Construction",date:"05 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-05-construction/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"What Time Is It?",date:"08 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-08-what-time-is-it/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Construction",date:"05 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-05-construction/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/1877249752" title="View \'CIMG0520\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2161/1877249752_a3c2db72d5.jpg" alt="CIMG0520" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>We\'ve started exterior construction.
