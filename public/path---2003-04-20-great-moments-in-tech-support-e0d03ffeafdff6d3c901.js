One thing I missed while I was gone was a new 4.x release of <a title=\"The FreeBSD Project\" href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\">FreeBSD</a>, so I opened up the ThinkPad on the patio and set about updating the BSD machine and the ThinkPad itself. Update source, build world, build kernel, install kernel, reboot, install world.</p>\n<p>Everything went smooth as silk, but a few minutes after booting up the ThinkPad, it starting beeping, quietly but consistently, every three minutes or so. Had I mistakenly turned on power management? A cosmetic flaw in my ThinkPad is that the battery doesn't charge. OK, that would be a fatal flaw for most users, but I only use the ThinkPad around the house and plugging in to an outlet isn't that big a deal. But power management would complain about a low battery.</p>\n<p>So I checked 'ps -ax', but no apmd is listed. I check /var/log/messages... nothing unusual there. The machine beeps again. I shut down X. I do a restart. The beeps continue. I turn the sound volune down to zero. I check the BIOS settings. The machine beeps again. Frustrated, I turn the whole thing off.</p>\n<p>The machine beeps again.</p>\n<p>Now that I have the screen folded down, I see that one of our cordless phone handsets is on the patio table. The battery is low, and it is beeping, quietly but consistently, every three minutes or so.</p>",fields:{title:"Great Moments in Tech Support",date:"20 Apr 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-04-20-great-moments-in-tech-support/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-04-20-great-moments-in-tech-support/",prev:{fields:{title:"Backpedal in Place",date:"20 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-20-backpedal-in-place/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Good Morning Sunshine",date:"22 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-22-good-morning-sunshine/"}}}}}});
