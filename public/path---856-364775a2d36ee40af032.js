Mama and I are taking a couple of days off together, and today we took Christopher on a harbor tour. Lots of boats there. Tomorrow we'll hit the beach at Lübeck again. Papa wasn't along last time.</p>\n<p>We were both somewhat consternated by the disappearance of our digital camera a couple of weeks ago, just before my parents arrived. We were at the point of accusing one another of losing it, or leaving it at the playground. This evening it showed up.  Christopher found it in his Lego box. Now we know who is really to blame.</p>\n<p>Mama promised her nephew that I'd put together a PC for him (nice of her to make promises for me), so I'm scrounging around for old parts. I had a 20 GB hard disk laying around, but seeing as Mama still had just 6 GB, I decided to let her have the 20. She really needs a Windows reinstall, but I was too lazy. I just Partition-Magic'd everything over. PM was even smart enough to make the new disk bootable.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dangerousmeta.com/\">Garret</a> and <a href=\"http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/\">Jörg</a> (<b>update</b> and <a href=\"http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/\">Martin</a> too, of course) are not the last bloggers on dial-up. We're still connecting via ISDN too. Now Mama is dialing in to her employer quite a bit, and we often have both ISDN lines blocked, often enough that her boss has suggested we get another ISDN line. I thought maybe the Telekom might want to sell us ISDN+DSL, but they didn't seem too anxious for our business (we'd have to <i>first</i> cancel our present line, <i>then</i> they could check if DSL is available for us). So we'll stick with our alternative provider EWE Tel. They're working on DSL, and might get it out here eventually. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blo.gs\">blo.gs</a> was down for a few hours, so my blog roll has a hole in it for today.

The crest appears to have passed Magdeburg without any parts of the city going under water. Tonight the TV reports are from Dönitz and Hitzacker, on what used to be the inner-German border. The crest seems to be 50 cm lower than expected, as water has been diverted into polders upstream. The problem up north will be not so much the Elbe itself, as the Elbe dykes seem to be holding, but rather the flood backing up into its tributaries. </p>\n<p>Mama has a cousin in a flooded village in Meck-Pomm. One of her department heads still has a house in Magdeburg, which is not flooded. Another lives in Geesthacht, of which parts (including one of Mama's restaurants) will be flooded by Saturday.
