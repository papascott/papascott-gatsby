It seems to exist only in the media. I\'m not so prominent as Adam, so the media never asked me about it, but I to agree. I have never personally experienced any sort of anti-Americanism at all here in Germany. There\'s no talk of boycotting trips to the US, or boycotting American products (well, except for Microsoft products :-). </p>\n<p>I\'m not going to say whether it\'s good or bad, but Americans seem to be more <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/02/Clashofcultures.shtml">emotional and sentimental</a> about things, feeling that their friendship has been betrayed. France opposes war with Iraq, and the US media accuses France of being <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/02102003/index.shtml">ungrateful</a> for D-Day. I\'d guess most Europeans don\'t see the connection.</p>\n<p>There are calls in the US to boycott French wine and Perrier water. Shouldn\'t they be boycotting Chrysler and T-Mobile as well?</p>\n<p><a title="t.com - almost a diary.

Although if I were forced to choose between war and Germany <em>Volksmusik</em>, I\'d almost choose war.</p>',fields:{title:"Transcontinental Media War",date:"13 Feb 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-02-13-transcontinental-media-war/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-02-13-transcontinental-media-war/",prev:{fields:{title:"Discontinued Merchandise",date:"12 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-12-discontinued-merchandise/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Duct Tape for Weasels",date:"15 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-15-duct-tape-for-weasels/"}}}}}});
