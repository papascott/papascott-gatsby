To his surprise, he met his 30-year-old wife, who was working as an part-time prostitute. Since neither was aware of the other\'s "little secret", the meeting resulted in a loud argument which could only be broken up by police. A police spokesman: "the further fate of the pair is unknown." (ddp)    </p>\n<p><b>Ich bin kein Homerun-Hitter</b><br />\n(I\'m no homerun hitter) The Twins are making international press.

The latest is Susan, moving from "editthispage" to http://www.2020hindsight.org. Looking at it from a selfish point of view, the more people who leave EditThisPage, the better the performance will be for those of us who stay. ";->"</p>\n<p>Changing URLs or having URLs go dead for days at a time... I can\'t afford anything like that at work. We sell "e-integrated financial solutions and services" (I guess that would be "banking software" in normalspeak), and any breakdown in reliability or security would reflect badly on the company. My web servers get pinged every five minutes... if a ping is missed, I get paged, and so does my boss. (The only times I\'ve been paged is when I\'ve been doing system maintenance and have forgotten to disable the ping.)</p>\n<p>Now I appreciate "Userland" hosting this domain at no cost, but UserLand does not do it out of the goodness of its heart. We help UserLand to load test and debug its software. How else could they get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=PapaScott&btnG=Google+Search">Google</a> to bombard their servers? How else would UserLand know that having Google bombarding its servers can cause problems?</p>\n<p>Now, I don\'t demand 99.999% reliability from "editthispage" either (that\'s 5 minutes downtime per year) or even 99% (5000 minutes downtime, or nearly 4 days). And since I run web servers for a living, I don\'t need to prove to myself that I can.

Take this weekend. Something is goofy with our ISDN connection. On the weekend, Mama diverts the calls from her mobile from work to our home phone. This weekend, several callers heard nothing but silence when they tried to call her (instead of a ring, or the answering machine, or a busy signal). The problem could be anywhere... the mobile provider, our ISDN provider, or in one of the three devices we have connected to ISDN (a PBX, a a/b converter, and a PC ISDN card). And Mama isn't particularly satisfied with hearing that I don't know where the problem lies. She just knows that she missed some important calls.</p>\n<p>Or take tomorrow. I knew Mama was staying in Munich Tuesday night, which means I've got to get Christopher ready Wednesday morning. But then just this evening she says that she has to catch an early flight tomorrow, meaning I have to get him ready tomorrow morning as well. She probably assumed that if I knew she was flying to Munich, that she would be leaving early.
