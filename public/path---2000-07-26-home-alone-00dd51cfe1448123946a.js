I love the favorites macro, but I don\'t like the fixed layout and even less that it forces the entire page to wait until it\'s loaded. </p>\n<p>The <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com">NetDyslexics</a> have shunted the calendar and their favorites to the bottom of the page, leaving only an anchor link at the top. That\'s a good idea too.</p>\n<p>We visited my old work colleagues at <a href="http://www.int-res.com">Inter-Research</a>.
