"Fire on the tracks at Wilhelmsburg. No S-Bahn until further notice. Passengers should take DB trains to Harburg." Except my car was between Harburg and Hauptbahnhof, so getting to Harburg would not have helped. After 30 minutes, I was ready to grab a cab... then the S-Bahn started rolling again. I made it home just 5 minutes before Christopher\'s bus. But I see I need to work out a Plan B for reaching the park-and-ride lot, since the S-Bahn is known to be occasionally buggy.</p>',fields:{title:"Nick of Time",date:"09 Aug 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-08-09-nick-of-time/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-08-09-nick-of-time/",prev:{fields:{title:"Getting It Wrong",date:"09 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-09-getting-it-wrong/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Ooops I Did It Again",date:"10 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-10-ooops-i-did-it-again/"}}}}}});
