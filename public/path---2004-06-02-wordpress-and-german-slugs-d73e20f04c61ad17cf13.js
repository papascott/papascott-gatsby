That is, a post entitled "Schröder Sucks" was encoded as schrder-sucks, which isn\'t legible at all. I went browsing through the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/">WordPress CVS repository</a>, and found that code for converting (rather than dropping) high-ASCII characters had been <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/wp-includes/functions-formatting.php?r1=text&tr1=1.29&r2=text&tr2=1.31&diff_format=h">added</a> after 1.2 was released. I copied the code into a plugin, and ended up with schroder-sucks, which is almost correct.</p>\n<p>In German, the convention is to transliterate umlauts into two letters (ä=ae, ö=oe, ü=ue). The CVS code has some two-character conversions, so I added the umlauts to that list in my plugin, and the result was schroeder-sucks, which is just what I wanted.  I\'ve saved the <a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/GermanPermalinks">German Permalinks plugin</a> at the WordPress Wiki. Note that to import correctly, the plugin needs to be installed and activated <em>before</em> the import.</p>',fields:{title:"WordPress and German Slugs",date:"02 Jun 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-06-02-wordpress-and-german-slugs/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-06-02-wordpress-and-german-slugs/",prev:{fields:{title:"Very Little Code",date:"02 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-02-very-little-code/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Futility in our time",date:"04 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-04-futility-in-our-time/"}}}}}});
