He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math's instruction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,&rdquo; Gonzales said. &ldquo;They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>",fields:{title:"Math Teacher Arrested",date:"20 Apr 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-04-20-math-teacher-arrested/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-04-20-math-teacher-arrested/",prev:{fields:{title:"Job Description",date:"20 Apr 2006",slug:"/2006-04-20-job-description/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Nothing Healthy on the Dollar Menu",date:"20 Apr 2006",slug:"/2006-04-20-nothing-healthy-on-the-dollar-menu/"}}}}}});
