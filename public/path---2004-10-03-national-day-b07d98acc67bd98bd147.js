On Saturday we took in some of the sights. At the Reichstag, the Volksfest for the national holiday on 3 October was already underway. There was a stage with Schlager music, booths with grilled and fried junk food, and lots of trinkets for sale. On the Reichstag lawn dozens of people were playing something that looked like a cross between bocce ball and ring toss. No security of any sort was noticeable. The sun was out,  weather was gorgeous, and I could think of no better atmosphere for a national holiday.</p>',fields:{title:"National Day",date:"03 Oct 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-10-03-national-day/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-10-03-national-day/",prev:{fields:{title:"I Spit On Your Grave",date:"03 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-03-i-spit-on-your-grave/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Presidential debate audio torrent",date:"03 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-03-presidential-debate-audio-torrent/"}}}}}});
