I should have thought of it. When Mama woke up, I decided to drive to the gas station in Jesteburg. I made it just 1,5 km before the tank ran dry. So I walked home, siphoned a liter from Mama into a Coke bottle, and walked back. I still taste gas in my mouth!</p>\n<p><b>Music</b></p>\n<p>My favorite band in high school was the Ramones. Living in rural Minnesota, it wasn't easy to get good music at all, so I was dependent on magazines, mail order, and trips to Minneapolis. So I discovered the Ramones by first reading about them, then ordering Road to Ruin via mail order. In spring of my senior year, we even took a road trip to Minneapolis to see them play at Uncle Sams. We had to sneak in because we were underage.
