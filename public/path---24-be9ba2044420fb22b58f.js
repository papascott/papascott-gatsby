Freely translated from the <a href="http://kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de/">Nordheide Wochenblatt</a> (30 June 2012):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Brawl on the Highway: a driver goes bezerk over failure to yield</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>When reason fails, some people rather trust their fists. That was the case last Thursday afternoon. The result: an injury and a whole list of charges. A driver from Buchholz (51) nearly cut off another driver (59) while pulling out of a driveway in Jesteburg. Both cars continued towards Lüllau when the older driver motioned for the first driver to stop. Both drivers get out of their cars, and the 59-yr-old driver swung a punch at the 51-yr-old. He was able to block the punch and threw one of his own, losing his cell phone in the process. The female companion of the 59-yr-old then picked up the cell phone and threw it onto a nearby field. Despite an intensive search, the cell phone was not found. A judge is scheduled to tell the two drivers what he thinks of their antics. </p></blockquote>\n<p>(Our son\'s reaction: Which highway was that? I want to find that phone!)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Follow Me to Bubble Tea",date:"26 May 2012",slug:"/2012-05-26-follow-me-to-bubble-tea/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Mysterious Invitation",date:"06 Jul 2012",slug:"/2012-07-06-mysterious-invitation/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Follow Me to Bubble Tea",date:"26 May 2012",slug:"/2012-05-26-follow-me-to-bubble-tea/",tags:"Y2012"},html:'<p>Time for a business post! A couple days ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/papascott/status/204798796243283969" title="4 big changes coming to German McDonald\'s in the next 3 weeks! Never a dull day for us!">teased on Twitter</a> that big changes were coming to German McDonald\'s in the next couple of weeks. I was going to wait until the marketing started before going into detail, but now that the <a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/neuheiten-bei-der-fastfood-kette-bei-mcdonalds-perlt-es-bald-seite-all/6674690-all.html" title="Handelsblatt: Bei McDonald’s perlt es bald">Handelsblatt newspaper has spilled the beans</a>, it\'s OK to come out now.</p>\n<p>The big one comes on June 11, when McDonald\'s starts selling bubble tea in McCafé. Bubble tea is a trend drink that originated in Taiwan and is fairly new in Europe. It\'s basically sweet tea with fruit syrup and tapioca "boba" pearls or flavored jellies. The bobas or jellies sink to the bottom of the cup and can be sucked up through the straw. With 2 sizes, 3 types of tea, 7 flavors, and 6 flavors of bobas and jellies, there are over 250 combinations possible. Bubble tea is sweet and certainly not low-calorie, but generally contains less sugar than soft drinks. There will be a coupon in the the June coupon booklet if you want to give it a try.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bubble-Tea-50.jpg"  alt="Bubble Tea"  border="0"  width="266"  height="354" align="left" />Bubble tea is the fastest growing segment of the fast food industry and is very popular for 13 to 20 year olds. Bubble tea shops generally import their ingredients. The jellies and bobas for McCafé Bubble Tea are produced in Germany especially for McDonald\'s and contain no additives. Bubble tea is a first for McDonald\'s in Europe (maybe worldwide?), and if it is successful here we\'re sure other countries will follow.</p>\n<p>The second change is not so spectacular. Starting June 4 McDonald\'s will sell Brötchen for breakfast, three types of normal German Brötchen: Kaiser-, Korn and Laugenbrötchen, either with traditional condiments (butter, jam, honey, Nutella) or as a sandwich. Brötchen have been very successful for McDonald\'s Austria and we think they will be here, too. The marketing people call it "local relevance". We just think that if you want to sell breakfast in Germany, you have to sell what Germans eat for breakfast, so it\'s a change we welcome.</p>\n<p>The other changes are already out: a new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/mcdonalds-deutschland/id524943492">McDonald\'s Deutschland iPhone app</a> with in-app couponing (starting with the June booklet, not exactly cutting edge anymore but it\'s a start) and new lower price-point <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/mcdeal.html">"McDeal" menus</a> that cost 3-something instead of 5- or 6-something like the "McMenüs".</p>\n<p>That\'s a whole lot to learn and train the next three weeks, but hey, if we wanted jobs where each day is just like the day before, we\'d be in a different business. :-)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"A Tale of Two Glasses",date:"16 May 2012",slug:"/2012-05-16-a-tale-of-two-glasses/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Brawl on the Highway",date:"30 Jun 2012",slug:"/2012-06-30-brawl-on-the-highway/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:24,pageCount:1101}}}});
