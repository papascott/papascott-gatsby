When I hurt my leg the other day, I was able to leave work early. It doesn't count against any time off or anything, and nothing gets docked off my pay. And when I went to the specialist to have it checked, it doesn't really matter to me whether workers comp covers it or not, because either way I don't pay. And when the doctor recommends that I rest the leg for a couple of days, that means I get the time off work, paid. And even if the company goes bankrupt and I lose my job, I do not lose my health coverage. I don't have to pay an arm and a leg for health care. That's how it works.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Nothing Broken, Nothing Torn",date:"26 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-26-nothing-broken-nothing-torn/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"",date:"27 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-27-how-did-schroeder-win/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Nothing Broken, Nothing Torn",date:"26 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-26-nothing-broken-nothing-torn/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>So, having jumped through all the hoops at the specialist and family doctor this morning, I\'m now sure that I didn\'t do any permanent damage to my <a title="Questions and Answers About Knee Problems" href="http://www.niams.nih.gov/hi/topics/kneeprobs/kneeqa.htm">knee</a> yesterday.
