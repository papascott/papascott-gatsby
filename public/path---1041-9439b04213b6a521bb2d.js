We only have two compact flash cards, and no laptop, so we have to find a way to upload somehow. We'll bring all the cables and the card reader. We have two sets of rechargable batteries, but the charger only runs on 230 V. I also burned a fresh CD with pictures... over 1500 files.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Behind the Curtain",date:"24 Sep 2000",slug:"/2000-09-24-behind-the-curtain/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Greetings from Arizona",date:"29 Sep 2000",slug:"/2000-09-29-greetings-from-arizona/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Behind the Curtain",date:"24 Sep 2000",slug:"/2000-09-24-behind-the-curtain/",tags:"Y2000"},html:'<p>Here\'s <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/24hours">what we did last Sunday</a>, a photo gallery that is part of the <a href="http://array.editthispage.com/24hours">Behind the Curtain</a> project.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.zopesite.com/behindthecurtain"><img src="http://www.arrayweb.com/btc/english.jpg" height="100" width="100" border="0" alt="Behind the Curtain: a day in the life of webloggers" /></a> <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/24hours"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/09/btc.jpg" height="100" width="100" border="0" alt="btc.jpg: " /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>This Sunday, in between packing and dealing with teething pain, we went to our 2nd \'Krabbelgottesdienst\', a \'crawling\' church service for toddlers, to celebrate the harvest.
