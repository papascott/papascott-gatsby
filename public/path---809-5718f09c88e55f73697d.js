The war in Iraq or transports of nuclear waste aren\'t enough to get real fired up about, but the dismantling of a squatter settlement by my favorite Interior Minister Ronald Barnabus Schill has brought rioters into the streets several times the past month. Of course, he\'s been taunting the rioters in the media, and reportedly had to be restrained by his assistants from showing up personally to inspect the law-enforcement efforts. Now, he has recommended to his fellow interior ministers that <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/12/07/101940.html">Germany obtain the Russian gas</a> used to end the theater siege in Moscow.    I hope he realizes that it would be useless against outdoor riots.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Nikolaus comes on Dec 6",date:"07 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-07-nikolaus-comes-on-dec-6/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Cold Legs",date:"08 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-08-cold-legs/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Nikolaus comes on Dec 6",date:"07 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-07-nikolaus-comes-on-dec-6/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Yesterday was <a href=\"http://www.training-for-germany.de/tips99/tip11.htm\">Nikolaus Day</a>, the morning when St. Nikolaus comes and fills your boots with chocolate (if you've been good), or just a branch (if you've been bad), or both (if you've been in-between).

We tried to make up for it by opening up one of his presents last evening, a double-decker train station for his wooden set. </p>\n<p>Have I mentioned that all of his presents this year will come from E-Bay? Does that make us evil parents? </p>\n<p>Also of note: Christopher used the toilet at home for the first time yesterday! That's no great accomplishment for him, he's been practicing at day care for over a week. It is an milestone for his parents, who finally got him to the bathroom in time. Yes, parents need toilet training, too.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"3x365",date:"05 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-05-3x365/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Party Like It's 1968",date:"07 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-07-party-like-its-1968/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"3x365",date:"05 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-05-3x365/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Three years ago a bunch of foolish early-adopters became online beta testers for EditThisPage.com, a strange new service where one could set up and edit a website using only a browser.
