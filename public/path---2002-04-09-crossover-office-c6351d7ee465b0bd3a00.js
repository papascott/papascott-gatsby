I found that it's not quite the cats meow, not yet, and I recommended that we wait for an update with bugfixes and then try it again. Display of fonts (rather important for Office documents) just isn't quite good enough yet for daily use on a relatively current machine (Mandrake 8,1), and I couldn't get fonts to display right at all on an older installation (Mandrake 7.x) .
