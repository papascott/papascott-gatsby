They don\'t say why, just that it\'s \'technically infeasible at this time\'. I suspect that we\'re too far from the "Central Office", so we\'re stuck with ISDN until something better comes along (the Telekom is supposedly testing lower bandwidth DSL that will work over longer distances). Our T-Online ISDN flatrate expires in October, but we can switch our ISDN line to <a href="http://www.ewetel.de">Ewetel</a> and use their flatrate. </p>\n<p>A program I use every day: <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net/">phpMyAdmin</a> has been updated with many improvements.
