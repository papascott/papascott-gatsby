I work mostly at the kitchen table, but it's handy to sometimes work elsewhere. With no USB 2.0, Bluetooth, high-speed WiFi, or ethernet (broken), the PowerBook is not so practical anymore. Normally I wouldn't consider a new first-generation product, but the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html\">specs</a>, the timing, and the price are all right. I don't need to burn DVDs, nor do I need a lot of disk space. The CPU will probably run hot, but it can double as a foot warmer in winter. The screen is small, but I can plug in a monitor when I'm in the kitchen. I don't do games, so slow graphics don't matter.</p>\n<p>I imagine that when school starts I'll be spending many afternoons as Christopher's taxi driver, so it will be good to have something portable to work with when I'm waiting for my next fare.</p>",fields:{title:"MB 13/1.83 CTO WHITE",date:"02 Jun 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-06-02-mb-13183-cto-white/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-06-02-mb-13183-cto-white/",prev:{fields:{title:"Camping",date:"02 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-02-camping/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Stormy Weather",date:"05 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-05-stormy-weather/"}}}}}});
