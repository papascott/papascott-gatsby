I politely said I wasn\'t interested and hung up. I never buy anything on the phone.</p>\n<p>The telemarketer from Tele2 apparently disagreed, and submitted an order in my name anyway. A letter arrived a week later thanking me for my registration. I immediately faxed a cancelation to Tele2 Customer Service.</p>\n<p>The cancelation was ignored. This weekend T-Com informed me that all calls from our line would be routed through Tele2. I called T-Com this morning, and they seemed to be familiar with the scam. When I mentioned I was calling about a pre-select change, the rep replied "You don\'t want it, right?". He assured me that the routing change would be ignored.</p>\n<p>I\'m not sure what advice I should give. I would never do business with Tele2, but even if you don\'t talk them, you might end up doing business with them anyway.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Stormy Weather",date:"05 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-05-stormy-weather/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"From the World Cup Front",date:"08 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-08-from-the-world-cup-front/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Stormy Weather",date:"05 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-05-stormy-weather/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/158812779/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/37/158812779_c3ab00bc46_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="02062006024" /></a></p>\n<p>We just returned from camping.

I work mostly at the kitchen table, but it's handy to sometimes work elsewhere. With no USB 2.0, Bluetooth, high-speed WiFi, or ethernet (broken), the PowerBook is not so practical anymore. Normally I wouldn't consider a new first-generation product, but the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html\">specs</a>, the timing, and the price are all right. I don't need to burn DVDs, nor do I need a lot of disk space. The CPU will probably run hot, but it can double as a foot warmer in winter. The screen is small, but I can plug in a monitor when I'm in the kitchen. I don't do games, so slow graphics don't matter.</p>\n<p>I imagine that when school starts I'll be spending many afternoons as Christopher's taxi driver, so it will be good to have something portable to work with when I'm waiting for my next fare.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Camping",date:"02 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-02-camping/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Stormy Weather",date:"05 Jun 2006",slug:"/2006-06-05-stormy-weather/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:215,pageCount:1101}}}});
