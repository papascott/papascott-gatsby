We've taken advantage of the extra hour a few times already. </p>\n<p>When we came to Germany the restricted shopping hours was the biggest thing I had to get used to. Back then shops closed at 6:30 pm during the week and 2:00 pm on Saturday. But the times have become longer and longer, first until 8:00 pm on weekdays, and then 8:00 pm every Saturday. Now it's a non-issue, and I imagine that sooner or later Sunday closing will also be a thing of the past.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Lead the World",date:"30 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-30-lead-the-world/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"09-F9-11-02-M-O-U-S-E",date:"02 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-02-09-f9-11-02-m-o-u-s-e/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Lead the World",date:"30 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-30-lead-the-world/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p>Which American politician just said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  America must "lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good."\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Germans who haven\'t been following the US presidential race that closely <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042702027.html">might be surprised</a>.
