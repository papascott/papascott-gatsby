It would be nice if Bloglines had a lastItem function, where you could get the latest n items for any feed. But you can only get the unread items or all items after a certain date/time. You also cannot be sure that the timestamps are consistent. And you are not assured of getting correct XML.  And the WebServices::BlogLines perl modules barfs if no items are returned. But once you work around all that, it\'s pretty easy. I\'ll post perl code once I get it cleaned up.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> It seems the timestamps from Bloglines are buggy, they use a 12-hour close but don\'t include AM/PM. So all timestamps get interpreted as being before noon GMT.</p>',fields:{title:"Bloglines Timestamps",date:"23 Oct 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-10-23-bloglines-timestamps/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-10-23-bloglines-timestamps/",prev:{fields:{title:"Telegraph | News | Guardian calls it quits in Clark County fiasco",date:"22 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-22-telegraph-news-guardian-calls-it-quits-in-clark-county-fiasco/"}},next:{fields:{title:"But will it work abroad?",date:"25 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-25-but-will-it-work-abroad/"}}}}}});
