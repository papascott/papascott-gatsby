However, it just didn\'t sell well enough to fit into the production system. Either they were made to order, meaning you had to wait 6 minutes at a minimum, or the sandwiches were held well over the 10 minute holding limit, and you can imagine how that tasted (not good).</p>\n<p>In the meantime McDonald\'s here has implemented a made-to-order system (BOP in McJargon) for deep-fried products, so we can now better offer a fresh but low-selling product. And the market for vegetarian sandwich is still there and growing, particularly among young women, and vegetarians cannot live on salads and french fries alone.</p>\n<p>The new Veggieburger now headlines <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/12/marketing-non-secrets-3/">the relaunched SMS line</a>, along with the Cheeseburger and the Chickenburger. The deep-fried patty is based on potatoes, with carrots, red bell peppers, corn and onions, with a creamy sauce, lettuce and cheese. It\'s not a low-calorie sandwich. The calories per 100g (250) is the same as the Cheeseburger, but the Veggieburger is 20% heavier so has more total calories (360 vs. 300). It tastes alright, I think, although when I have 300 calories to spare on a snack I\'d personally take a Cheeseburger. :-)</p>\n<p>As businesspeople we\'re happy with how the product is starting out. Sales are in the neighborhood of the Hamburger, and it\'s attracting a target group that wouldn\'t be so inclined to visit us. The price of 1.10 means we\'ve broken the 1 barrier, and we can see how the guests react.</p>\n<p>There are no TV spots yet for the Veggieburger, but it\'s pictured briefly in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGzdP41MKrw">this cute spot</a> for SMS. Even for non-German speakers, I think the dialog is clear (the father is going to McDonald\'s and asks if she wants anything). Don\'t think the spot would fly in the States, though... :-)</p>\n<p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zGzdP41MKrw&hl=en_US&fs=1&" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zGzdP41MKrw&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Headlines",date:"15 Feb 2010",slug:"/2010-02-15-headlines/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Anything But Sports",date:"10 Apr 2010",slug:"/2010-04-10-anything-but-sports/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Headlines",date:"15 Feb 2010",slug:"/2010-02-15-headlines/",tags:"Y2010"},html:"<p>If even my mother says that my blog hasn't been updated for a while, it must be time to write something. Here are the headlines from the past couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>* My birthday (48) came and went. Another year older and deeper in debt.</p>\n<p>* We've had snow and ice in the Hamburg area for 7 weeks straight now, the longest anyone can remember. Even the newspapers are sick of it. The road departments have long run out of salt and sand, so the streets and sidewalks are horrible. We hear temperatures might get back above freezing at the end of the week.<br />\n* The cold weather means our restaurant sales are way below plan. We figure the snow has cost us 40K in sales and counting, especially in Dibbersen which is only reachable by car. Our lobby furnace has needed constant attention, and just today the water pipes leading to the McCafé froze solid.</p>\n<p>* Christopher's midterm grades were good (solid Bs, or since they use numbers here, solid 2s). Since elementary school ends after the 4th grade in our state, we have to choose a secondary school for next year. He was recommended for the <i>Gymnasium</i>, the academic track. There is no secondary school in Jesteburg, so we have several nearby schools to choose from.</p>\n<p>So, spring can start any time now!</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Male Striptease...",date:"03 Feb 2010",slug:"/2010-02-03-male-striptease/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"V is for Veggieburger",date:"04 Mar 2010",slug:"/2010-03-04-v-is-for-veggieburger/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Male Striptease...",date:"03 Feb 2010",slug:"/2010-02-03-male-striptease/",tags:"Y2010"},html:'<p>(That title should attract attention!)

According to police a fight broke out Monday evening with a 30-year-old injured with pepper spray. A young man had dropped his pants. At 11:35 several young men entered the restaurant. As a 20-year-old admitted he didn\'t have enough to pay for his order, the 27-year-old female cashier told him \'you can strip for it\'. The young man pulled down his pants. The cashier\'s boyfriend (waiting for her in the lobby) did not find that funny at all, and attacked the young man. In the resulting tumult the 30-year-old was sprayed in the eye, and both sides filed assault charges with the police." </p>\n<p>Moral: be careful with suggestive selling!</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/region/harburg/article1367223/Schlaegerei-im-Schnellrestaurant.html">story is also at abendblatt.de</a>, but you have to go through a paywall to be able to read it.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Value Added Tax on Nothing",date:"26 Jan 2010",slug:"/2010-01-26-value-added-tax-on-nothing/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Headlines",date:"15 Feb 2010",slug:"/2010-02-15-headlines/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:44,pageCount:1101}}}});
