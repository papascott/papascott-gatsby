German women are expected to stay home and care for their children until they are out of school. Luckily we can afford an alternative. </p>\n<p>I\'m (mostly) back up and around, just in time for the work week. Sounds like I missed a good picnic yesterday. The big kids were all playing on a slide too big for Christopher, so he made his own slide on a little hill on the ground, sliding down face first. He came home dirty and exhausted.</p>\n<p>Putting heat in perspective: Having lived in both Minnesota and Arizona, my personal feelings of hot and cold are somewhat extreme. I can\'t really use the word \'hot\' to describe any weather in Germany. For example, today is a pleasant, sunny north German summer day, 22&deg;C. According to <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com">Hal</a>, Sunday <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2001/07/01">evening</a> in Las Vegas was nearly twice as warm: 43&deg;C (109&deg;F) at 9pm. But in the desert it\'s a dry heat.</p>',fields:{title:"Back in black",date:"02 Jul 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-07-02-back-in-black/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-07-02-back-in-black/",prev:{fields:{title:"Sick day",date:"01 Jul 2001",slug:"/2001-07-01-sick-day/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Time to relax",date:"03 Jul 2001",slug:"/2001-07-03-time-to-relax/"}}}}}});
