Let\'s hope I never have to find out!)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I suspect our first trip to Paris will not be a romantic second honeymoon, but rather a visit with Christopher to see the <a href="http://www.disneylandparis.com/">mouse</a> at Disneyland Paris.</p>',fields:{title:"Paris Later",date:"23 Apr 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-04-23-paris-later/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-04-23-paris-later/",prev:{fields:{title:"Methamphetamine wreckage in Montana",date:"23 Apr 2005",slug:"/2005-04-23-methamphetamine-wreckage-in-montana/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Rent A German",date:"23 Apr 2005",slug:"/2005-04-23-rent-a-german/"}}}}}});
