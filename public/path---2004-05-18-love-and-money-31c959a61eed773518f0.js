At any rate, on the first day already I cashed in my keys and purchased a personal license, as my way of saying thanks for the past 2 years of great software. Now 6A and I are quid, they don't owe me anything anymore.</p>\n<p>But if I were to recommend MT to an small to mid-sized organization, $199 is a pretty steep entry price, especially if they aren't yet convinced that weblogs are a good thing.</p>\n<p>My idea would be to drop the distinction between personal and commercial use, keep the unsupported free version as it is, charge $29 per blog for the supported version, with volume discounts starting with the 6th blog.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I won't be dropping MT because I object to the license. I have been playing around with WordPress because I find the technology interesting, and especially contrasting the static-build of MT vs. the dynamic approaches. I also find the idea of seamlessly switching backends intriguing. (MT on even-numbered days, WordPress on odd-numbered days, and Blosxom on Sundays?).</p>\n<p>It's all about love and money. You need both.</p>\n<p>Scott</p>",fields:{title:"Love and Money",date:"18 May 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-05-18-love-and-money/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-05-18-love-and-money/",prev:{fields:{title:"Dear Mena,",date:"18 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-18-dear-mena/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Postbank to offer instant transfers",date:"18 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-18-postbank-to-offer-instant-transfers/"}}}}}});
