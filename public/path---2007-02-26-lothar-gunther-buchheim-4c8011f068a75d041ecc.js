The film, but especially <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Das-Boot-Lothar-Gunther-Buchheim/dp/0304352314/">the book (in English translation)</a>, were very important to me  when it became clear that I would be spending a permanent relationship with a Ger(wo)man, and with a nation full of Nazis (so I thought). The novel shows the pointlessness of war, the humanity of the sailors, and the extreme claustrophia aboard the U-Boat. Thanks to <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=12347">Garret for posting the obituary</a>.</p>',fields:{title:"",date:"26 Feb 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-02-26-lothar-gunther-buchheim/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-02-26-lothar-gunther-buchheim/",prev:{fields:{title:"Attempted Denial-of-Service Attack",date:"24 Feb 2007",slug:"/2007-02-24-attempted-denial-of-service-attack/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Organic Foods",date:"28 Feb 2007",slug:"/2007-02-28-organic-foods/"}}}}}});
