That it has not suggests either that this shift doesn\'t interest us because it affects outsiders, or that we no longer consider torture or near-torture to be beyond the bounds of civil conduct.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://q.queso.com/archives/001675" title="QDN: Slate%u2019s primer on torture">(via Queso)</a></p>',fields:{title:"When Exceptions Become the Norm",date:"27 May 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-05-27-when-exceptions-become-the-norm/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-05-27-when-exceptions-become-the-norm/",prev:{fields:{title:"Working for the Clampdown",date:"25 May 2005",slug:"/2005-05-25-working-for-the-clampdown/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Hot Wheels Gorleben",date:"28 May 2005",slug:"/2005-05-28-hot-wheels-gorleben/"}}}}}});
