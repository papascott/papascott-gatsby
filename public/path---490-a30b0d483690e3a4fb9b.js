Take this evening, for example. Of the 5 \'Top Stories\', 3 are on the US and Iraq (if I want to read Bush-bashing, I\'ll go closer to the source), 1 is about sports (Oliver Kahn), and 1 about German news (Finance Minister Eichel). Even under \'Politics\' there is little serious domestic news (2 of 7 stories; taxing brothels does not qualify as serious). While other <a title="Davids Medienkritik" href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/">blogs</a> complain about alleged bias in the German media, I would be happy if the premier German news site simply could be somewhat more <em>relevant</em>.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Up In The Air",date:"10 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-10-up-in-the-air/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Don Park's Daily Habit - Tortures for Dummies",date:"11 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-11-don-parks-daily-habit-tortures-for-dummies/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Up In The Air",date:"10 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-10-up-in-the-air/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>We're now a month into the process of registering Christopher for kindergarten, and we are more confused than ever.
