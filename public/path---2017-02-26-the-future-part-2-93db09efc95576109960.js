I was worried it would be too dark, but the spots of color make it look brighter live than it appears in the photos.</p>\n<p>It of course has all the innovations in Dibbersen, plus we now serve "Barista Quality" coffee at the front counter, meaning that the espresso drinks are made with the <a href="http://www.wmf-espresso.de/index_en.php#coffee-machine-section">portafilter machine</a> in McCafé.</p>\n<p>With all this future we need to take time to catch our breaths. Our 3rd drive-thru restaurant on the Autobahn A1 at Rade will join the future in early 2018.</p>',fields:{title:"The Future Part 2",date:"26 Feb 2017",url:"https://papascott.de/2017-02-26-the-future-part-2/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2017-02-26-the-future-part-2/",prev:{fields:{title:"Song of the Day: I Can't Drive 55",date:"09 Feb 2017",slug:"/2017-02-09-song-of-the-day-i-cant-drive-55/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Travis CI",date:"23 Jul 2017",slug:"/2017-07-23-travis-ci/"}}}}}});
