In the UK, half the executive team started on the shop floor and 25 per cent are women.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(via <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,472681,00.html">Spiegel Online</a>)</p>',fields:{title:"",date:"20 Mar 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-03-20-mcdonalds-seeks-to-redefine-mcjob/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-03-20-mcdonalds-seeks-to-redefine-mcjob/",prev:{fields:{title:"Samsung Q35 Red",date:"19 Mar 2007",slug:"/2007-03-19-samsung-q35-red/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Bricks and Mortar",date:"27 Mar 2007",slug:"/2007-03-27-bricks-and-mortar/"}}}}}});
