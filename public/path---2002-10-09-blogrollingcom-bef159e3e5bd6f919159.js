It looks like they have added a lot of features that I like, such as chronological sorting and an RSS feed. They update more often, and they seem to have no restriction on how often I pull the feed. So I'm giving them a try. I'm importing their HTML directly for now, rather than groking RSS, but it still doesn't look bad at all.</p>",fields:{title:"blogrolling.com",date:"09 Oct 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-10-09-blogrollingcom/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-10-09-blogrollingcom/",prev:{fields:{title:"Movable Type 2.5",date:"08 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-08-movable-type-25/"}},next:{fields:{title:"papascott.com",date:"09 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-09-papascottcom/"}}}}}});
