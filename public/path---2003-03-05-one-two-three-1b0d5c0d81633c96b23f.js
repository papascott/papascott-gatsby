Sure enough, it\'s showing right now on BR. </p>\n<p>OK, the film mostly stars Cagney, as a hyperactive Coca-Cola executive in post-war pre-Wall Berlin. For example, he\'s trying to close a deal with the Russians. They offer him a Cuban cigar.</p>\n<p>"We made a deal with Castro. He sends us cigars, we send him missiles."</p>\n<p>"You\'re being cheated! This cigar is badl!"</p>\n<p>"So are the missiles."</p>\n<p>You\'ll have to see the movie yourself to know how Cagney "learns umlauts" with his German secretary.
