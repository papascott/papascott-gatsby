"Judenfrei and Spass dabei" (No Jews and we\'re having fun). "Deutsche wehrt Euch! Wählt FDP!" (Germans defend yourselves! Vote FDP!) Not only did noone notice the joke, but the local FDP chairman had himself photographed in all seriousness with the fake campaigners.   </p>\n<p>The German <a href="http://flagr.antville.org/20020610/63363/">flagrant blogger</a> posted this, so I guess the humor can\'t be <i>too</i> politically incorrect to post. The FDP is considering legal action against the magazine.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Big Bagger!",date:"10 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-10-big-bagger/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Happy Birthday",date:"11 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-11-happy-birthday/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:886,pageCount:1101}}}});
