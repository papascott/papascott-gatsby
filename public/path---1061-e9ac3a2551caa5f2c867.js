We've all been encouraged to take vacation on Friday, June 2, when the movers start. In theory, they will finish and we can start work bright and early on Monday morning, June 5. We'll see.</p>\n<p>Also in theory, we have a duplicate web server and firewall, and will be able to move with no interruption of web and mail service. We'll see. (Ascension is called 'Himmelfahrt' in German, and a suicide mission is a 'Himmelfahrtskommando'. That's a bad omen.)</p>\n<p>The bad news is there's no more free parking. The garage costs over $100 per month.
