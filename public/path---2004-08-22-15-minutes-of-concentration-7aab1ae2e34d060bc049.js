How often does a 4-year-old leave a parent alone for 15 minutes? Yes, my point exactly.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/22/15-minutes-of-concentration/#more-2022">below</a> is the Movable Type 3.x plugin for which I\'ve been trying to write a front-end. It emulates the WordPress function in which you can automatically moderate a comment with several hyperlinks. Save this as <code>MT_DIR/plugins/modhref.pl</code>, and set $maxhref to the maximum number of links you want to allow. </p>\n<p>Once I was half-way done, I saw that it would pretty much be a knock-off of Chad Everett\'s <a href="http://jayseae.cxliv.org/moderate/">Moderate plugin</a>, just using a different critereon for moderation (Moderate checks the age of the posting and the lastest comment for the post, and moderates if either is too old). The criteria could probably be combined into a single plugin to perform simple tests on comments not explicitly banned by <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a>.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<pre># Modhref: Moderate comments with too many links.\n# A Plugin for Movable Type\npackage MT::Plugin::Modhref;\nuse vars qw($VERSION);\n$VERSION = \'0.01\';\nuse strict;\nuse MT;\nuse MT::Comment;\nuse MT::Plugin;\n# configuration variables (TODO put into CGI interface)\nmy $maxhref = 4; # maximum number of links before a comment is moderated\nmy $reg_ok = 1;  # pre-approve registered commenters?\n<p>my $plugin = new MT::Plugin({\nname => \'Modhref\',\ndescription => \'Moderate comments with too many links.\',\ndoc<em>link => \'<a href="http://www.papascott.de/">http://www.papascott.de/</a>\'\n});\nMT->add</em>plugin($plugin);\nMT::Comment->add<em>callback(\'pre</em>save\', 10, $plugin, &#x26;modhref);\nsub modhref {\nmy ($eh, $obj) = @<em>;\nmy $count = 0;\nunless ($obj->id) { # only check new comments\n# don\'t check registered comments unless we say so\nreturn if ($obj->commenter</em>id &#x26;&#x26; $reg_ok);\nmy $text = $obj->text;\n$count++ while $text =~ /&#x3C;a <sup id="fnref->"><a href="#fn->" class="footnote-ref">></a></sup><em>href<sup id="fnref->"><a href="#fn->" class="footnote-ref">></a></sup></em>>/gi;  # count links\n$obj->visible(0) if ($count > $maxhref); # moderate if we find to many\n}\n}\n1;</pre></p>',fields:{title:"15 Minutes of Concentration",date:"22 Aug 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-08-22-15-minutes-of-concentration/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-08-22-15-minutes-of-concentration/",prev:{fields:{title:"Used Car",date:"21 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-21-used-car/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Perspective",date:"23 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-23-perspective/"}}}}}});
