The chains that consumers view as being most socially responsible are McDonalds, Chick-fil-A, Subway, Starbucks and Applebees.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Interesting that healthy menu and obesity weren\'t among the top issues. It is also interesting that in Germany corporate responsibility seems to be a non-issue. Corporations are assumed to be irresponsible, and any effort to demonstrate social responsibility is dismissed as a PR gag. Or am I wrong?</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Lectures about Guns",date:"18 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-18-lectures-about-guns/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"GmbH und Co KG",date:"19 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-19-gmbh-und-co-kg/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Lectures about Guns",date:"18 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-18-lectures-about-guns/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p>In the wake of the shootings in at Virginia Tech, there have been the usual comments in the German media about the lack of gun control laws in the US. I can think of a few ways to point the finger back here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The largest employer in my wife\'s home town is <a href="http://www.sauer-waffen.de/index.php?id=sauer&amp;lang=en">Sauer &amp; Sohn</a>, "Germany\'s oldest\'s gun manufacturer" since 250 years.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In 2006 there were nearly 350,000 registered hunters in Germany</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where we live, the main social club in most towns is the <em>Schützenverein</em>, or shooting club. The biggest social event of the year is the <em>Schützenfest</em>, where shooting is combined with alcohol. The <a href="http://www.germany-tourism.de/ENG/destination_germany/master_tlevents-id1099-fstadt_event_allgemein.htm?cc_lang="><em>Schützenfest</em></a> in Hannover can be compared with the Oktoberfest in Munich or the Dom in Hamburg.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we just moved here I was told I could make big money smuggling trigger mechanisms from the US into Germany. Gun fans in Germany could import non-functional weapons from the US, but the mechanisms were not so easy to get.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It seems every few months there is a gun accident involving children here, almost always involving a legal but unlocked gun from a parent. The US National Rifle Association may be a gun lobby, but they also teach basic gun safety, which includes keeping one\'s guns locked when stored.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As usual, Andrew at German Joys <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2007/04/guns_and_tirade.html">makes the point</a> much more logically than I ever could. Lax gun laws in the US make life slighty unsafer than in Europe, but only slightly.
