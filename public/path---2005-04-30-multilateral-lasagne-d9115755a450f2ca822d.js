The French recipe was very general; there were no measurements, just make a batch of <a href="http://frenchfood.about.com/od/frenchcuisinebasics/a/bechamel.htm">Bechamel</a> sauce, then a batch of red meat sauce, etc. The German version was somewhat longer and gave exact instructions: 750 ml milk, 50 g flour, 50 g butter for the Bechamel, and so on. </p>\n<p>The English instructions were more to the point: take one can of Bechamel sauce, one can of meat sauce...</p>\n<p>Alas, the German version became our favorite lasagne recipe, but they\'ve stopped putting it on the package. We (or at least I) keep forgetting the proportions for the Bechamel sauce.
