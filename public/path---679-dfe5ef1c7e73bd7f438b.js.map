He will speak with his US colleague Colin<br />\\nPowell and with Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. It is the first US<br />\\nvisit of the Foreign Minister since the Iraq war. At that time<br />\\nGerman-American relations were heavily strained by the \\\"no\\\" of the German<br />\\nGovernment to the war. Therefore Fischer's visit is also an attempt to<br />\\nbetter relations. Questions for Hans Ulrich Klose of the SPD,<br />\\nvice-chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Bundestag.</p>\\n<p>NDR info.: Mr. Klose, how you judge the current relationship between the<br />\\nUSA and Germany?</p>\\n<p>Klose: It's beginning to improve. One must add however, the problems<br />\\nbetween Europeans and Americans are not only attributable to the attitude<br />\\nin the Iraq war. The relationship changed after the end of the cold war<br />\\nand because America, not least due to the experiences in the Kosovo war,<br />\\nhas at least partly lost interest in NATO. The Iraq war brought the debate<br />\\nto a head.</p>\\n<p>NDR info.: At that time you violently criticized the chancellor because of<br />\\nhis categorical No to the participation of the German Federal Armed Forces<br />\\nat the Iraq war. Do you see that differently today?</p>\\n<p>Klose: No, there I must correct you: I did not criticize the chancellor<br />\\nbecause of his No to the war, because I was also not for the war. I<br />\\ncriticized the chancellor because of his diplomatic mistakes, the fact<br />\\nthat he specified his position unilaterally, under the title of \\\"the<br />\\nGerman way\\\", and he declared that, \\\"whatever the UN decides, we will not<br />\\nparticipate\\\". This political behavior indeed questioned the very<br />\\nprinciples of German foreign policy. And that was the core of my<br />\\ncriticism.</p>\\n<p>NDR info.: Now however the the arguments of US president, which at that<br />\\ntime justified the war, are being disproved. Did he also no make clear<br />\\nmistakes?</p>\\n<p>Klose: The Americans made at least as many mistakes as the Europeans. One<br />\\ncan say, the political management around this conflict was deplarably bad<br />\\non both sides of the Atlantic. One of the largest American errors consists<br />\\nof the fact that they did not plausibly state the reasons for their<br />\\nintervention in Iraq. However, the error of the Europeans lay in the fact<br />\\nthat many of them deliberately minimized the danger posed by Iraq.</p>\\n<p>NDR info.: The question now is, how can German-American relations become<br />\\ncloser again. Unofficially the USA wish that German German Federal Armed<br />\\nForces soldiers would engage themselves in the postwar Iraq. Chancellor<br />\\nSchroeder rejected this, Fischer also. Was this correct?</p>\\n<p>Klose: I believe indeed that German soldiers in the Iraq would not be<br />\\nuseful at present, in order to be honest, because one cannot go into such<br />\\nan deployment without intensive preparation. Successes of the German<br />\\nsoldiers with \\\"nation building\\\" in other parts of the world lay in it that<br />\\nthey were excellently trained, with the right attitude to adjust to<br />\\ncertain situations. One does not create that from today to tomorrow.<br />\\nPerhaps it would be possible to refer to the civilian component.

Therefore it would be better, that each country would<br />\\nbring in the strengths which they have. The principle must be however that<br />\\nwe, the Germans, we, the Europeans, have no interest that the Americans<br />\\nfaile in Iraq fail and withdraw themselves possibly prematurely. One can<br />\\nformulate: the greater danger for stability in the Near East is not that<br />\\nthe Americans might remain too long - no, the danger is that that they do<br />\\nnot stay long enough.</p>\"},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"title\":\"NY Times: Springsteen's Homecoming, With 55,000 Guests\",\"date\":\"16 Jul 2003\",\"slug\":\"/2003-07-16-ny-times-springsteens-homecoming-with-55000-guests/\"}},\"previous\":{\"fields\":{\"title\":\"entenhausen.blogplan.de\",\"date\":\"17 Jul 2003\",\"slug\":\"/2003-07-17-entenhausenblogplande/\"}}},{\"node\":{\"fields\":{\"title\":\"NY Times: Springsteen's Homecoming, With 55,000 Guests\",\"date\":\"16 Jul 2003\",\"slug\":\"/2003-07-16-ny-times-springsteens-homecoming-with-55000-guests/\",\"tags\":\"Y2003\"},\"html\":\"<p><a title=\\\"We've been all around the world.
