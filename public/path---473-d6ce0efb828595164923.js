I\'m in a musical mood lately. When I started listening to <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/03/17/helden/" title="PapaScott: Helden">Wir Sind Helden</a>, I thought to myself that every line of their lyrics could be the tagline for a weblog. And now I\'ve done it. My tagline is now a random Helden lyric. The script is literally 3 lines of PHP (stolen from the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?rev=1.3&view=auto">Hello Dolly plugin </a>in WordPress), so I won\'t bother to repeat it here.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 27 Sep 2004</strong> I\'ve switched musical directions. The lyrics are now <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/26/wouldnt-it-be-nice/">Wouldn\'t It Be Nice by the Beach Boys</a>, but may return to the Helden in the future.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"A Million Days",date:"05 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-05-a-million-days/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Party Up",date:"05 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-05-party-up/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"A Million Days",date:"05 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-05-a-million-days/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>If you've been following the soap opera that is my workplace, be assured that all is not peaches and cream. Yes, the company has found an investor, a venture capital fund rather than a competitor, so our existance is ensured for the short term and entire departments will not be rationalized away. But the investors are expecting further cost-cutting, which means management will be proposing a salary reduction package in the next few days. However, we've been in cost-cutting mode for over 3 years now, a mode that is very tiresome, and whatever trust the employees had in management is long gone. Noone is in the mood to give up anything.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the investor has a share in some 30 other high-tech companies, some of whom might be interested in our software.
