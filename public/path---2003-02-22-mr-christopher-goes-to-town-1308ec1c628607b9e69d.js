There I treated Cristopher to a harbour tour on the <a href="http://www.louisiana-star-hamburg.de/">Louisiana Star</a>, and we drank capuccino and hot chocolate as we looked at the big container ships. We then went downtown and took a look at the home electronics store <a href="http://www.saturn.de/">Saturn</a>. This was Christopher\'s first long outing without the buggy, so he walked the entire day and came home exhausted.</p>',fields:{title:"Mr. Christopher Goes To Town",date:"22 Feb 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-02-22-mr-christopher-goes-to-town/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-02-22-mr-christopher-goes-to-town/",prev:{fields:{title:"Long Weekend",date:"21 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-21-long-weekend/"}},next:{fields:{title:"At The Circus",date:"23 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-23-at-the-circus/"}}}}}});
