Mama's employer restructured in the US last year, and no longer has a regional office in Phoenix (merging with Denver). Since Mama is a Regional Manager, moving to Phoenix via her employer is out (Denver is <b>not</b> an acceptable alternative). But we looked at a nice abobe-style townhouse anyway, just for fun.</p>\n<p>We stayed with Mama's old boss, who still has a job but no longer an office (see above). Instead she has a lot of lonely travel and is somewhat jaded on the company. Our other friend has worked for 3 different oil/convenience store companies in the past year without changing her desk. But she's happy. We all went to a D-Backs game our last night. We had fun, and they won.</p>\n<p>LAX sucks for catching connections, especially with a stroller. To switch terminals, you have to go outside and wait for a crowded non-accessable bus. FRA was almost as bad; no bus, but a maze of twisty tunnels, all alike. AMS or even KEF in Iceland are much nicer. Our domestic flights with America West, however, went very well, despite our <a href=\"/2002/03/25\">fears before booking</a>.</p>\n<p>Should I be worried that it is now past noon, and Christopher is <b>still</b> sleeping?</p>",fields:{title:"This and That from Phoenix",date:"11 May 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-05-11-this-and-that-from-phoenix/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-05-11-this-and-that-from-phoenix/",prev:{fields:{title:"PHP Reading",date:"10 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-10-php-reading/"}},next:{fields:{title:"And Thanks for all the OSX Fish",date:"12 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-12-and-thanks-for-all-the-osx-fish/"}}}}}});
