These latter reactions are wholly inappropriate. Spain is not America, but it is an ally, and a representative democracy. It is not our place to criticize whom our allies select to be their leaders, so long as the elections are free and fair, and democracy is not undermined. The people of Spain have spoken, and the rest of us must respect their decision. Aznar had been a steadfast supporter of the United States and President Bush during a very trying time in our history. For his loyalty, he deserves our undying gratitude. Muchas gracias, Se√±or Aznar."</p>',fields:{title:"Citizen Smash on Spain",date:"16 Mar 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-03-16-citizen-smash-on-spain/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-03-16-citizen-smash-on-spain/",prev:{fields:{title:"CeBIT Optional",date:"16 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-16-cebit-optional/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Helden",date:"17 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-17-helden/"}}}}}});
