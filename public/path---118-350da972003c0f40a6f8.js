Beer is a standard menu item in Germany, but it's a very low seller. We'd only sell 3 or 4 each day. The permit to sell beer costs 960 per year, so we didn't have to think very hard to decide that it was not worth it. Instead we will offer alcohol-free beer, which fits in better with the image we want to present anyway.</p>\n<p>There's an Aral gas station across the street, and anyone who really wants beer would go there in the first place. They have better selection and don't pour the beer into a paper cup.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"100 Hours",date:"26 Jun 2007",slug:"/2007-06-26-100-hours/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Before...",date:"29 Jun 2007",slug:"/2007-06-29-before/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"100 Hours",date:"26 Jun 2007",slug:"/2007-06-26-100-hours/",tags:"Y2007"},html:"<p>We're now less than 100 hours away from owning a restaurant.</p>\n<p>I worked 2 closing shifts over the weekend (until 5 and 3 am), then back at 11:30 on Monday (yes, <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/06/22/training-day/#comment-34506\">DaveP</a>, I have good shoes, from Ecco).

The outgoing manager at our soon-to-be restaurant was gracious enough to allow me to work a few shifts behind the counter before we take over (with no monetary compensation, of course). I've been concentrating on the kitchen, since that's where the most changes have taken place since 1994, when I last ran a shift at a restaurant. I won't be running shifts full time, since my main priority is still a little boy who's about to finish the first grade, but I can fill in for late shifts during the week. </p>\n<p>After two days I can say the changes in the kitchen are all for the better (especially being able to see orders as they are being placed), but after over a decade of desk work, I'm going to have to get used to being on my feet all day.
