So we got one. At 10 kg, it\'s not light reading, but it\'s everything a Calvin and Hobbes fan could hope for (short of a rivival of the daily comic strip).</p>\n<p>Calvin and Hobbes has (for now) replaced Harry Potter as Christopher\'s bedtime reading (with on-the-fly translation by Papa). Since he\'s Calvin\'s age, I think he sees the stories not so much as humor than as absolute truth.</p>',fields:{title:"Let's go exploring!",date:"24 Jul 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-07-24-lets-go-exploring/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-07-24-lets-go-exploring/",prev:{fields:{title:"Sharp Objects in the Lawn",date:"21 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-21-sharp-objects-in-the-lawn/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Scandinavian Park",date:"24 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-24-scandinavian-park/"}}}}}});
