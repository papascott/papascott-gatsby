He\'s too sophisticated to have anything to do with the baby or the other cats. Here he\'s alone in our bedroom when everyone else is downstairs.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/helga0117.jpg" height="225" width="300" border="0" alt="helga0117.jpg: " /><br />\nThis is Helga, our streetwise tabby cat. She likes adults, but stays away from children. She\'s taken the longest to acknowledge the baby, although she\'s gotten pretty close here. (And, yes, that\'s a stuffed version of the Maus Newsletter mascot behind her.)</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/karlheinz0117.jpg" height="225" width="300" border="0" alt="karlheinz0117.jpg: " /><br />\nThis is Karl-Heinz, Mama\'s favorite. He\'s accepted Christopher, if only to stay close to her. This is a typical pose, sleeping obscenely on his back.</p>',fields:{title:"Happy Birthday Grandma Shirley",date:"17 Jan 2000",url:"https://papascott.de/2000-01-17-happy-birthday-grandma-shirley/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2000-01-17-happy-birthday-grandma-shirley/",prev:{fields:{title:"Up too late",date:"16 Jan 2000",slug:"/2000-01-16-up-too-late/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Kohl Quits, Won't Tell",date:"18 Jan 2000",slug:"/2000-01-18-kohl-quits-wont-tell/"}}}}}});
