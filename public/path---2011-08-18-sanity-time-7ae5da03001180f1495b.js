It\'s been over five weeks since my last post</p>\n<p>Our summer "vacation" was a busy as we suspected it would be. The restaurant in Rade, the truck stop store without a truck stop, is as busy as we hoped it would be. The self-serve "Easy Order" kiosks are in but are not being frequented that much yet (around 3% of guests). I suspect most people walk by not knowing what they are. Our first store in Dibbersen has been holding its own, down just a bit from last year despite having the brand new store just a few km away. </p>\n<p>However it was our store in Harburg that gave us the nicest surprise. A couple of weeks ago we found our neighboring Burger King had subtly changed.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/non-bk.jpg" alt="Non bk" border="0" width="500" height="373" style="float:right;" /></p>\n<p>It had become a non-Burger King. Apparently BK had cancelled their franchise. The restaurant is still open as a generic burger joint, but it doesn\'t look open and we\'re getting a surprise plus. Now we just need to get staffed to match.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile we had sent our son to my parents in Minnesota for 3 weeks, after the success of his Easter voyage. He arrived just at the peak of the heat wave (110°F), but it was cooler at the lake and he pretty much caught all the sunfish he could get (final count over 60). I flew over for the last few days of his visit to catch up with my folks and bring him home. It was nice to get a couple of days of sanity time. </p>\n<p>Today school starts, our son is in the 6th grade, and our schedule gets back to "normal", whatever normal turns out to be this fall.</p>',fields:{title:"Sanity Time",date:"18 Aug 2011",url:"https://papascott.de/2011-08-18-sanity-time/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2011-08-18-sanity-time/",prev:{fields:{title:"Open",date:"11 Jul 2011",slug:"/2011-07-11-open/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Driving the E-Smart",date:"01 Sep 2011",slug:"/2011-09-01-driving-the-e-smart/"}}}}}});
