And the Democrats have already begun to gnash their teeth. Didn\'t Nader cost them the last election? Since I voted for Nader in 2000, I can answer that with no. To think otherwise is to believe that voters are dumb. They are not. My vote was actually not <em>for</em> Nader, but <em>against</em> Gore, whom in 2000 I saw <a title="PapaScott: Vision Thing" href="http://www.papascott.de/2000/11/04/1361.php">no reason</a> to support, nothing to distinguish him from the other candidate. If Nader weren\'t on the ballot, I would have voted for another 3rd candidate, or for nobody at all. Things are different now. Bush is a known quantity, we know what we have if he is re-elected. Distinguishing the two major candidates is not going to be a problem this year. So let Nader run. I won\'t be voting for him, and he won\'t make any difference.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Knight in Shining Armor",date:"22 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-22-knight-in-shining-armor/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"The Fear Mongers",date:"22 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-22-the-fear-mongers/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Knight in Shining Armor",date:"22 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-22-knight-in-shining-armor/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><img alt="crh_knight.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/crh_knight.jpg" width="320" height="269" border="0" /></p>\n<p>Christopher is set for his <em>Fasching</em> party tomorrow.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"trainedmonkey: brian wilson is back in the studio completing smile, the followup to pet sounds",date:"21 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-21-trainedmonkey-brian-wilson-is-back-in-the-studio-completing-smile-the-followup-to-pet-sounds/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Let Him Run",date:"22 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-22-let-him-run/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"trainedmonkey: brian wilson is back in the studio completing smile, the followup to pet sounds",date:"21 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-21-trainedmonkey-brian-wilson-is-back-in-the-studio-completing-smile-the-followup-to-pet-sounds/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="Good Vibrations, 40 years later" href="http://trainedmonkey.com/entry/1642">trainedmonkey: brian wilson is back in the studio completing smile, the followup to pet sounds</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"AmericanCandy.de - Sweets, Drinks, Snacks, Dips & More",date:"21 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-21-americancandyde-sweets-drinks-snacks-dips-more/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Knight in Shining Armor",date:"22 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-22-knight-in-shining-armor/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:524,pageCount:1101}}}});
