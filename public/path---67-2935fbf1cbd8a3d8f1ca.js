So far it hasn't been the case. Coordinating the paperwork between us, McDonald's, the attorney, the tax accountant, the chamber of commerce <em>(Handelskammer)</em>, and the commercial register <em>(Handelsregister)</em> has so far been just as complicated if not worse, and we haven't even started with the last two yet. Last year the GmbH was not officially registered until two weeks after we started business. Legally, we were running on a hope and a prayer for 14 days.</p>\n<p>This time we've run into technical snafus.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first draft of the KG contract was sent to us via email. The sender had never corresponded with us before, and Gmail thus classified the attachment full of legal language as spam. We discovered the mail 4 days later.</li>\n<li>Trying to fax the contract for approval, the recipient didn't answer. After a few trys, and checking that the number was correct, we called the office. The fax machine had been disconnected. \"Oh, that's why we haven't gotten any faxes this week.\" </li>\n<li>Corrections to the contract were faxed to our private voice number, which we've never given out for business, and without caller ID so we had no idea who was trying to fax. After three tries, I guessed that it must be something important... I forwarded the voice line to the fax number and hoped that they would try a fourth time. They did.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Somehow it's reassuring that the technical glitches of the last century can still occur in this one. And, as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/papascott/statuses/1005568106\">I asked on Twitter yesterday</a>,  if anyone knows of a good service to forward received faxes to a mail or web server, please let me know.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Army of Stamps",date:"12 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-12-army-of-stamps/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"The Barking/Braying/Meowing/Crowing Manhole Cover in Bremen",date:"18 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-18-the-barkingbrayingmeowingcrowing-manhole-cover-in-bremen/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Army of Stamps",date:"12 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-12-army-of-stamps/",tags:"Y2008"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3024242121" title="View \'CIMG0643.JPG\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3187/3024242121_a76195d01f.jpg" alt="CIMG0643.JPG" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>The rubber stamps have arrived for our firm, so we can start doing business! </p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Expansion",date:"11 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-11-expansion/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Paper Chase",date:"15 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-15-paper-chase/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Expansion",date:"11 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-11-expansion/",tags:"Y2008"},html:"<p>Our business is expanding! On January 1, we'll be purchasing two additional McDonald's restaurants in Hamburg-Harburg: a free-standing McDrive with McCaf&eacute; on the Winsener Strasse 231, and a satellite restaurant in the Marktkauf Center, Seeveplatz 1.</p>\n<p>Winsener Strasse is the closest restaurant to our original store in Dibbersen, and is nearly a twin. It was built just a few months earlier, has the same basic layout, and like Dibbersen was just remodeled with McCaf&eacute; and Gym & Fun. It has also an additional challenge... a Burger King is situated right next door. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.marktkaufcenter-harburg.de/\">Marktkauf Center</a> satellite is a limited-menu shopping center restaurant with limited seating in downtown Harburg. There are two other McDonald's satellites within walking distance (<a href=\"http://www.phoenix-center-harburg.de\">Phoenix Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.harburg-arcaden.de/\">Harburg Arcaden</a>), so we'll have to concentrate on the guests in our shopping center and giving them the best experience possible.</p>\n<p>We've set up a separate firm, the Petersen-Hanson Familienrestaurants KG, to run the two restaurants in Harburg. We've also reserved the domain <a href=\"http://www.mcdonalds-harburg.de/\">mcdonalds-harburg.de</a>, which for now redirects to our existing website. </p>\n<p>We were offered the restaurants at the end of September, just before the Expat Meetup in Bremen. So if my fellow expats are wondering why I was somewhat reserved at the Meetup, you now know why (although I'm not all that extroverted to begin with).</p>\n<p>The changes for our day-to-day routine will likely be as big as when we bought the first restaurant in Dibbersen, as we'll have to shift our efforts from managing a single restaurant to supervising three. On my side, I expect the administration to at least quadruple, since we'll not only have three times the paperwork, but will have take the time to decide how it all should be allocated. </p>\n<p>An immediate consequence is that our Christmas trip to the States will be cut short, at least for Frauke. We'll fly in together on the 23rd, but she'll fly home on the 27th to complete the takeover, while Christopher and I will be staying in Minnesota for another week. We'll be together with my parents for the two most important holidays of the year, Christmas and Christopher's birthday, and as long as we can round up a Christmas goose for the annual goose leg dinner, we can manage the few days apart.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Yes We Can in 2036",date:"05 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-05-yes-we-can-in-2036/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Army of Stamps",date:"12 Nov 2008",slug:"/2008-11-12-army-of-stamps/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:67,pageCount:1101}}}});
