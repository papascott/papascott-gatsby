Some bands started to make little films that went along with their music, and (according to my friends) I said that would someday the all the rage, that watching music would be bigger business than listening to music. My friends said I was crazy, but some years later MTV was born. I never saw a cent from Viacom. (I actually don\'t rememeber saying that, but my high school friends insisted I was a true visionary. They also said I was a cross between Spock and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman">Alfred E. Neuman</a>, so I can never be sure if they were putting me on or not.)</p>\n<p>Of course these days noone watches music, MTV doesn\'t even show music videos anymore, they\'re all pirated and downloaded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. I always thought YouTube was a stupid idea, playing other people\'s videos that nobody pays for. How do they make any money? I guessed I missed the point, since today <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&amp;siteid=mktw&amp;guid=%7BFADE6E8C-1E83-4177-817E-14A0D5E18ABD%7D">Google is buying YouTube for $1.65 billion</a>, even though "YouTube right now generates very little, if any, actual revenues, analysts say".</p>\n<p>So if any of my old friends are reading, I\'ve lost the touch. I have no idea what\'s cool anymore.</p>',fields:{title:"Internet Killed the Video Star",date:"09 Oct 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-10-09-internet-killed-the-video-star/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-10-09-internet-killed-the-video-star/",prev:{fields:{title:"Comeback",date:"08 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-08-comeback/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Travel Plans",date:"13 Oct 2006",slug:"/2006-10-13-travel-plans/"}}}}}});
