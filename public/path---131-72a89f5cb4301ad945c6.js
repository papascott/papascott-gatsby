Nasima El-Zein grew up in Berlin, graduated from <em>Realschule</em>, helped foreign schoolchildren as a volunteer in the problem neighborhood of <em>Neukölln</em>, helped them with math and German. Who came up with the idea to deport this woman to a land where a violent father awaits to lock her up and send her to a forced marriage? Today the <a href="http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/print/berlin/652190.html"><em>Berliner Zeitung</em> wrote</a> that the Kurdish woman has been pressured by the Turkish police, and threatened with violence. I think not only the behavior of the Turkish authorities, but also that of Berlin\'s Interior Senator, to be a scandal. One can only suspect that because the police and the authorities are unable to handle a few wild Turkish-Lebanese families in <em>Neukölln</em> and <em>Rudow</em>, the so-called "bouncer mafia", that they are making an example of this young woman, making a scapegoat of someone who is integrated and cannot defend herself, deporting her to Turkey simply to quiet public opinion.</p>\n<p>  These actions from Hr. Körting are not only reprehensible, but also violate the principles of his party, the SPD, and human rights... As a party member, I will formally request the expulsion of Hr. Körting from the party. And when the young woman has not returned to Berlin by the end of May 2007, I will take my party book, which documents over 35 years of membership in the SPD, and publicly burn it (i.e. a video will be posted here) and I will urge my fellow party members to do the same.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jörg himself lives in <em>Neukölln</em>, so I\'m sure he knows what he\'s talking about. I\'ve heard of some wild deportation cases in Germany, but this seems to rank with the wildest of them.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"webzweinulljobs.de",date:"08 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-08-webzweinulljobsde/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Shrek on a diet in McDonald's Happy Meal gig",date:"09 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-09-shrek-on-a-diet-in-mcdonalds-happy-meal-gig/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"webzweinulljobs.de",date:"08 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-08-webzweinulljobsde/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p>Nico has yet <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3422">another new project</a>, namely a technical job board entitled <a href="http://webzweinulljobs.de/">webzweinulljobs.de</a>, born from his experience how difficult it is to find good administrators and developers.

However, I've kind of developed myself into a hole.</p>\n<p>I set up the design using <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/\">RapidWeaver</a>, a nice website creation tool for OS X. I choose it mostly because there are some nice ready-made design templates available (I'm colorblind, and can't match colors to save my life) but also because I knew there was an add-in to enable Heidi to edit her site online.</p>\n<p>However, we ended up deciding to use photo galleries instead of straight web pages, telling her story with pictures instead of words (for example, her <a href=\"http://heidi-ritter.de/schwerpunkte/schwerpunkte.html\"><em>Schwerpunkte</em> page</a>). RapidWeaver can produce static photo galleries, but they can't be edited with the online tool. And since she doesn't have a Mac, I can't simply install RapidWeaver for her. So now I'm stuck.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I played with the slide show creator at [slide.com](http://www.slide.com/), and it's almost what I want. It creates a Flash slideshow with captions (see my <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/schwerpunkte.html', '1', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=426,height=350'); return false;\">test slideshow</a> with the <em>Schwerpunkte</em> photos). It's editable online, and it's quite easy to add pictures, change text, and rearrange the order. It would be nice to be have more control over the speed and text format, and I don't need links to the original pictures. Another possibility would be a Windows application so Heidi can create an maintain her slideshows locally. There are a number of free and commercial possibilities, but I haven't started exploring yet.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking that an embedded Flash applet would be nice since then I can put the site into a mini-CMS like Wordpress, and I only have to design the main pages and not a separate gallery as well.</p>\n<p>So I'll put the question to the audience. Do you have any ideas on how I can best include a set of pictures on a small commercial site that's easy to edit and maintain?</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Fetch, Doggie, Fetch!",date:"08 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-08-fetch-doggie-fetch/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"webzweinulljobs.de",date:"08 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-08-webzweinulljobsde/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:131,pageCount:1101}}}});
