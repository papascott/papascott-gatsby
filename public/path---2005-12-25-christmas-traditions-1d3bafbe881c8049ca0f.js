He comes at dusk on Christmas Eve, while we are attending the children\'s church service. We leave the back door open for Santa, since our chimney is sealed off. He leaves his present on the sled, and also delivers packages from Grandma and eBay.</p>\n<p>These are all Christmas traditions we just made up. We suspect that this will be the last year Santa makes such a grand performance, since next year Christopher will be a sophisticated 1st grader and may have his doubts about the Christmas Man.</p>\n<p>Looking at the photo now online, I see we had heavy winds in our living room, some of the candles are leaning quite badly.</p>',fields:{title:"Christmas Traditions",date:"25 Dec 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-12-25-christmas-traditions/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-12-25-christmas-traditions/",prev:{fields:{title:"Outage at blogg.de",date:"23 Dec 2005",slug:"/2005-12-23-outage-at-bloggde/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Mass dodo grave",date:"25 Dec 2005",slug:"/2005-12-25-mass-dodo-grave/"}}}}}});
