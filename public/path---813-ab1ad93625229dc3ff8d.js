This time it's a failure of day care coordination. The original failed (our <em>Tagesm√ºtter</em> is at a conference), the backup failed (she forgot to inform her substitute that we were coming), and the backup of the backup failed (the substitute is leaving on vacation today). And the tape in the vault is missing (Oma is out of town). And there is no Plan D. So I'm burning a vacation day today with Christopher. At least it's Mama's last trip for the fall, and she won't have another big trip until March.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"News Flash - Politicians are Liars!",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-news-flash-politicians-are-liars/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Third Thursday in November",date:"21 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-21-third-thursday-in-november/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"News Flash - Politicians are Liars!",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-news-flash-politicians-are-liars/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Spiegel Online <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,223429,00.html\" title=\"Wahlbetrugsausschuss: SPD erwartet Schlammschlacht\">reports</a> on the Union plan to form a Bundestag special committee to investigate whether SPD/Green candidates lied about expected tax revenue during this fall's election campaign. How stupid does the Union think the voters are? This just goes to show that the Union has no constructive ideas of its own. Of course politicians are liars! All Angela Merkel has to do is ask her old boss Helmut Kohl about reunification and 'blooming landscapes' and 'noone will be worse off'. Then again, Kohl has a history of stonewalling Bundestag special committees.</p>\n<p><b>Update 05.12.02</b> Greeting to readers from suburban Tennessee! Yes, the Union is still going ahead with its special committee, and Finance Minister Eichel has promised to give as good as he gets (as in, how did Stoiber intend to pay for his &eruo;70 billion of campaign promises). So let the mud slinging begin again, although I would rather have an opposition that would, uh, propose some constructive alternative policy?</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Klappe!",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-klappe/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Some Guys Have All The Luck",date:"21 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-21-some-guys-have-all-the-luck/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Klappe!",date:"19 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-19-klappe/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Christopher is playing with his Lego trains, and he is telling me <a href=\"http://dict.leo.org/?search=klappe\">'Klappe!'</a>, which means 'Shut up!', as in <em>Halt die Klappe!</em>  I'm thinking, what kind of words is he learning at day care anyway? Then Mama explains he means the actual meaning of the noun, as in a flap, latch or valve. He means the switch on the Lego tracks. I need to turn it so the train can pass. I guess a switch can be a latch laying on its side.
