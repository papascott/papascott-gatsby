And gone. </p>\n<p>Good thing I noticed she was gone, since often during the week we don't see each other in the morning. Otherwise I would have driven off, and Christopher would have played trains all day long alone at home.</p>\n<p>Turns out she had an early meeting this morning, but could come home early this afternoon. She was so happy that she could cover for me in the afternoon that she forgot to say that I had to take her shift in the morning. I was a bit angry at first, but since I'm the flexible one, and not the breadwinner one, I grudgingly woke Christopher, brought him to his <em>Tagesmutter</em>, got stuck in traffic on the way to the city, and got to work 2 hours later than I had planned.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Sweet or Sour!",date:"31 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-31-sweet-or-sour/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"One Of Us Now",date:"02 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-02-one-of-us-now/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Sweet or Sour!",date:"31 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-31-sweet-or-sour/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>For the first time we've had trick-or-treaters come to the house in Lüllau, 2 groups of girls.

The portage system, baed on FreeBSD ports, sounds good, and this could finally be a maintainable source-based Linux system. Even if you have an install CD, there\'s still a lot to download, since the sources are not on the CD (I cheated and did a test install at work, then burned a CD with the distfiles). But even though you no longer have to compile your own compiler when installing, you still have to compile your own kernel. And they don\'t let you copy the kernel from the install CD. I guess that would be cheating. I haven\'t compiled a Linux kernel from scratch in many moons, we\'ll see how many tries it takes to get something that boots. My test install at work didn\'t boot, but it was under VMWare so maybe it was doomed to fail anyway. <b>Update</b> In the time it took to write this post, the kernel finished compiling and worked on the first try. However, grub took two tries to work correctly. But now my Gentoo is happily updating itself.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Cold Shoulder",date:"30 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-30-cold-shoulder/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Sweet or Sour!",date:"31 Oct 2002",slug:"/2002-10-31-sweet-or-sour/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:823,pageCount:1101}}}});
