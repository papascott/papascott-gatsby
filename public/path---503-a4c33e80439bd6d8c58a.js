We want to eventually migrate to  <a title=\"SAMBA Web Pages\" href=\"http://www.samba.org/\">Samba 3</a>, which my predecessor warned me would be really hard. I didn't really believe him, mostly out of ignorance, since I have absolutely no clue how Windows networking works. Samba-TNG has been acting up the past few weeks, destroying user profiles and refusing to play with Win2K SP4, so when my boss asked about Samba 3, I foolishly said yes, let's do it. I set up a test domain, and was able to log on, mount volumes, and print. So we decided to go live with Samba 3. I could log on, mount volumes and print, but the real Windows users were having tons of problems. So we bailed out and went back to TNG.</p>\n<p>I had copied over the smbpasswd, the domain SID, and the group map. I guess that's not enough. It looks like I need to copy over machine SIDs (or are they RIDs?), and I haven't a clue how to do that. On Google I can't find anything about 'migrating from samba tng to samba 3'. So for now I'm stuck. Sometimes I'm as dumb as I think I am.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Homework",date:"30 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-30-homework/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Self Promotion",date:"31 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-31-self-promotion/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Homework",date:"30 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-30-homework/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><img alt="crh_homework.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/03/crh_homework.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" /></p>\n<p>He\'s just coloring, but he says it\'s homework.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Engineer Genes",date:"30 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-30-engineer-genes/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Samba 3... not!",date:"30 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-30-samba-3-not/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:503,pageCount:1101}}}});
