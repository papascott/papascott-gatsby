Not for this website, but for our personal domains, <a href="http://photos.shcon.com">photos</a> and mail. My old hoster is going out of business. If I may pat myself on the back, the main domain is already done and took less than an hour. The trick was that I had the DNS at <a href="http://www.easydns.com">EasyDNS</a>. Once I knew the new IP address, I just changed it on their web interface and it was active within 15 minutes. So no horror story of being unreachable for days!</p>\n<p>FWIW, my domains are now at <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair</a>, where I\'ve done business before. FreeBSD, SSH access, and they got the site going within a couple hours of my online application.</p>',fields:{title:"Move Along",date:"18 Sep 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-09-18-move-along/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-09-18-move-along/",prev:{fields:{title:"World in a Stupor",date:"17 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-17-world-in-a-stupor/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Nimda Simba",date:"19 Sep 2001",slug:"/2001-09-19-nimda-simba/"}}}}}});
