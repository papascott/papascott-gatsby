Today, I saw the same story (translated into German) on <a title="Abendblatt.de: Wiedersehen in Ramstein" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/04/28/153344.html"> page 4 of our local paper</a>. The Abendblatt reported that it had been forwarded by email to a reader in Hamburg. It\'s nice to see the story in a German paper, but blogs were faster!</p>',fields:{title:"Showing Respect",date:"28 Apr 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-04-28-showing-respect/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-04-28-showing-respect/",prev:{fields:{title:"McWiFi",date:"28 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-28-mcwifi/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Spring Barrage of Holidays in Germany",date:"28 Apr 2003",slug:"/2003-04-28-spring-barrage-of-holidays-in-germany/"}}}}}});
