The war in Iraq or transports of nuclear waste aren\'t enough to get real fired up about, but the dismantling of a squatter settlement by my favorite Interior Minister Ronald Barnabus Schill has brought rioters into the streets several times the past month. Of course, he\'s been taunting the rioters in the media, and reportedly had to be restrained by his assistants from showing up personally to inspect the law-enforcement efforts. Now, he has recommended to his fellow interior ministers that <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/12/07/101940.html">Germany obtain the Russian gas</a> used to end the theater siege in Moscow.    I hope he realizes that it would be useless against outdoor riots.</p>',fields:{title:"Party Like It's 1968",date:"07 Dec 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-12-07-party-like-its-1968/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-12-07-party-like-its-1968/",prev:{fields:{title:"Nikolaus comes on Dec 6",date:"07 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-07-nikolaus-comes-on-dec-6/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Cold Legs",date:"08 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-08-cold-legs/"}}}}}});
