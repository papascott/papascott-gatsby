I\'ve been pain-free since the beginning of March, although I do feel some tension or tiredness in my lower back from time to time. I\'ve been going to a physiotherapist (my next-door neighbor), and she\'s been teaching me the basics... how to sit, how to stand, last week I tried walking.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.dr-wolff.com/"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dr-wolff-back-training.jpg" alt="Dr Wolff Back Training" title="Dr Wolff" align="right" /></a> Last week I started a 8-week training course at a local fitness studio. They have a set of machines from <a href="http://www.dr-wolff.com/">Dr. Wolff</a> to train the upper and lower back. The cost is covered by health insurance, and since we are supposed to work out on our own between sessions, it works out like a trial membership.</p>\n<p>The best part is that since the initial injection at the beginning of January, I\'ve taken absolutely no pain medication. I no longer have the TENS device (it was more a nuisance than a help), and I\'m not taking any more chiropractic treatments.</p>\n<p>My therapist (er, my neighbor) would like me to ergonomically optimize my workplace. Since I\'m about to switch jobs, I\'m not sure where my new workplace is going to be. I guess I\'ll have to work that out with my new boss.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Bridge Days",date:"28 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-28-bridge-days/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"McDonald's on Sabine Christiansen Tonight",date:"29 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-29-mcdonalds-on-sabine-christiansen-tonight/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Bridge Days",date:"28 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-28-bridge-days/",tags:"Y2007"},html:"<p>While admiring the new design of the <a href=\"http://www.gsjesteburg.de/\">website</a> for Christopher's school (looks like somebody has a Web 2.0 logo generator) a couple of days, I thought I'd check the the list of school holidays. When we put up paper calendars for 2007, we didn't write in the school holidays since we're still new at this school parenting business.</p>\n<p>Sure enough there are some holidays coming up that we didn't plan for. The first is this coming Monday, the <strong>Day before May Day</strong>. This seems to be a sporadic holiday only celebrated when May Day falls on a Tuesday. We're totally unprepared... we not only have no plans, we didn't even take the day off from work. In our defense, my sister-in-law who has two kids in <em>Gymnasium</em> didn't know about it either, although the logistics of leaving 7th graders at home is a bit easier than for a 1st grader.</p>\n<p>The next unexpected holiday was not so unexpected, the <strong>Day after Ascension</strong>. Ascension only falls on Thursday, and the next day must be the most unproductive work day on the German calendar. That the schools are also closed is then logical.</p>\n<p>Finally there's a holiday that's totally new for us, <strong>Pentecost Tuesday</strong> (would that be Whittues in <a href=\"http://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.com/\">BrE</a>)? In our years in Germany, we've never noticed that the kids go back to school a day later after the Pentecost weekend, probably because we've never had a kid in school.</p>\n<p>So along with <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/31/report-card-vacation/\"><strong>Report Card Vacation</strong></a> celebrated in February, we have a number of new holidays that we will be celebrating for the next 10 or 13 years (whichever the case may be). Note that these holidays are regionally variable. The schoolkids in Hamburg, for example, celebrate a yearly <strong>Ski Vacation</strong>, even though there is no place in Hamburg to ski.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Corruption and Locusts",date:"27 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-27-corruption-and-locusts/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Back to Back",date:"29 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-29-back-to-back/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Corruption and Locusts",date:"27 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-27-corruption-and-locusts/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p>One the one hand, here it is currently <em>en vogue</em> to complain about amoral American hedge funds, comparing them to locusts.
