(I\'ve read blogs about it <a href="http://www.worldwideklein.de/?id=P175_0_3_0">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020517">here</a> and <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/05/17">here</a>.) But I can\'t imagine what good it would have done, say, for the government to have known a couple of weeks ahead of time what was going to happen, without knowing exactly when, where and who, without somehow convincing the public of the seriousness of the threat. The airlines and the public would have never gone along with the security measures necessary, especially considering the false alarms in the past. Or am I missing something?</p>\n<p>Once the public was convinced, they were a thousand times more effective than any government action would have been, as shown by the passengers of AA Flight 93. They took action within minutes. The government, it seems, takes months. </p>\n<p><b>Update</b> I forgot to mention, remember that the Hamburg flat of Atta et al. was searched by police the very evening of 9/11, less than 6 hours after the attacks. That made it pretty clear that somebody knew something ahead of time.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Google Can Be Dangerous For Some People",date:"16 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-16-google-can-be-dangerous-for-some-people/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Layoffs",date:"19 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-19-layoffs/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Google Can Be Dangerous For Some People",date:"16 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-16-google-can-be-dangerous-for-some-people/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Extremely strange but true: <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/05/15.html">Der Schockwellenreiter</a> Jörg Kantel (perhaps Germany\'s best known blogger,  <a href="http://focus.de/F/2002/19/Internet/tagebuecher/tagebuecher.htm">recently profiled</a> in <a href="http://www.focus.de">Focus</a> magazine) found out that some people are too dumb to use Google. To sum up in English: His boss was sent a mail asking why his institute employs a pedophile named Erik Möller as IT head. But there is no Erik Möller employed there, and the IT head is Jörg. What happened? Erik Möller is a journalist who wrote a story <a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/co/4158/1.html">\'Children are Pornography\'</a> on the politcs of censorship in Germany. The said nitwit did a Google Search on \'Erik Möller pädophil", which pointed to an entry in Jörg\'s forum (citing a different article by Mr. Möller). The dumbhead thought that Jörg\'s picture was that of Mr. Möller. clicked to reach Jörg\'s resume, and mailed the accusation to his employer. Jörg is considering legal action.</p>\n<p>The lesson. Some people believe everything they think they read in the Internet, and cannot be distinguished from idiots.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Misc 14.05.2002",date:"14 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-14-misc-14052002/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Would It Have Made A Difference?",date:"17 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-17-would-it-have-made-a-difference/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Misc 14.05.2002",date:"14 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-14-misc-14052002/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p><a href="http://davespicks.com/archive/2002/0514.html">Dave\'s Picks</a> says that although I may feel less safe in Europe now, he felt a whole lot unsafer when visiting behind the Iron Curtain, back when there was a Iron Curtain. </p>\n<p>If I can count days correcty, we must have been in Phoenix the same time as <a href="http://booknotes.weblogs.com/2002/05/14">Craig</a>.</p>\n<p>I\'m still bouncing my workstation back and forth between <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> Linux and <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>.
