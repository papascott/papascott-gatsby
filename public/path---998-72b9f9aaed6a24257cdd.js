Christopher\'s first day at the beach. He fell face first into the North Sea and he loved it. For a couple without children it would have been a relaxed romantic weekend. As for us, well, Christopher was awake at 5am Sunday morning. Enough said. At least the weather was halfway decent, cool but mostly sunny.</p>\n<p>Mama, Director-Executive-Supermaus by day, Mama-Supermaus on early mornings, evenings and weekends, has her birthday today. She\'s celebrating in the way she celebrates every Monday, by being at the office at 7 am to prepare for a day full of weekly meetings. Happy birthday anyway!</p>\n<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/06/11">Dave</a> is waiting for an e-mail from the afterworld. Hey, you think ISPs in this world are bad.

I was sure the German media would find good cause to revile Bush as the new Federal Executioner.
