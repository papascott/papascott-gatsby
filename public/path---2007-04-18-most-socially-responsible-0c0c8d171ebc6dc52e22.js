The chains that consumers view as being most socially responsible are McDonalds, Chick-fil-A, Subway, Starbucks and Applebees.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Interesting that healthy menu and obesity weren\'t among the top issues. It is also interesting that in Germany corporate responsibility seems to be a non-issue. Corporations are assumed to be irresponsible, and any effort to demonstrate social responsibility is dismissed as a PR gag. Or am I wrong?</p>',fields:{title:"Most Socially Responsible?",date:"18 Apr 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-04-18-most-socially-responsible/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-04-18-most-socially-responsible/",prev:{fields:{title:"Lectures about Guns",date:"18 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-18-lectures-about-guns/"}},next:{fields:{title:"GmbH und Co KG",date:"19 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-19-gmbh-und-co-kg/"}}}}}});
