Never mind that we haven't skated in 15 years. That's the advantage of being a spoiled only child, you can create your own events, just like that. Of course Christopher can't skate, or rather, skates only as well as you'd expect a 4-year-old to do for his second time on skates. But he loved watching the <a href=\"http://www.zamboni.com/\">Zamboni</a> machine. </p>\n<p>However, the rest of the afternoon was ruined by being stuck behind an accident on the Autobahn on the way home. German police tend to not let any traffic go by an accident site, they'd rather shut the Autobahn down completely. So we came to a complete stop, and counted 15 emergency vehicles that passed by us. We stayed put for 2 hours, then we were told to turn around and drive back to the last exit. That took half an hour to work out, since Autobahns are not designed for driving the wrong way, and then we had to find an alternate route home. So now we are all three tired and pissed off. </p>\n<p>A few years ago we once stood still for 3 hours behind an accident, but that time they let us pass rather than making us turn around.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Monkey Noises",date:"25 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-25-monkey-noises/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Citizenship and Dual Nationality",date:"29 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-29-citizenship-and-dual-nationality/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Monkey Noises",date:"25 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-25-monkey-noises/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>Looking through one of my new Bloglines feeds, I saw this about <a title="North Sea Diaries - Slumming it" href="http://www.north-sea.net/archives/208">Spanish soccer fans taunting black English players</a> with monkey noises. That reminds me of my first sports experience in Hamburg. In the fall of 1990, I ventured alone to the Volksparkstadion to watch <a href="http://www.hsv.de/">HSV</a> play Frankfurt, and was disgusted at how the Hamburg fans grunted like monkeys every time the black Frankfurt striker touched the ball. I\'ve never seen HSV since, and still hold a mild distain for HSV and their fans. But I only rarely make fun of children whose parents make them wear HSV gear. Only rarely. But more often when HSV is doing poorly.</p>\n<p>Funny thing is, that black striker was Anthony Yeboah, who later in his career played for... you guessed it, HSV.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Horse",date:"25 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-25-horse/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Stillstand",date:"27 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-27-stillstand/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Horse",date:"25 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-25-horse/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><img alt="horse.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/archives/fotos/horse.jpg" width="320" height="215" /></p>\n<p>In Germany, Santa has a sidekick, the <em>Nikolaus</em>, who comes ahead of time and cases the joint for the big guy.
