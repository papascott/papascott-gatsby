It\'s made of bread, so he\'s having it for breakfast.</p>\n<p>Since we didn\'t get around to searching for Easter eggs yesterday, we did it this morning. Christopher didn\'t see the point of hard boiled eggs at first, but finding a chocolate bunny made the adventure worthwhile. We\'ve still got 2 packages of Kinder chocolate that he got as presents for Easter. We\'ll have to try to parcel them out as slowly as we can.  </p>\n<p>Otherwise, the weather was gorgeous. Christopher was able to spend the whole day outside. With Bobby Car races with neighbor Carolin, a bike ride to the playground, "helping" Mama in the garden, he kept busy all day too.</p>\n<p>And in case anybody is wondering, Europe is already on Daylight Savings Time as of yesterday.
