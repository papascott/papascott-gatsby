He slept a lot, until 8:30 in the morning and in the afternoon for over 3 hours, much than he would have at daycare. Now he's slept through the night for the first time in a week. And he woke up bright and healthy, so he spent a happy day at daycare.</p>\n<p>As for me, it was the commute from hell. All the roads were iced up, plus there the Autobahn A1 was closed due to an accident, and all the traffic was re-routed through Buchholz. Since our daycare is in Buchholz, that meant I could drive in to drop off Christopher, but could not get out. </p>\n<p>The drive could have easily taken two hours. I couldn't even turn around to get back home. I decided to drive away from the Autobahn to the next village with a train station, and got to work in about 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>My day didn't improve any after I got to work, so I really would have been better off staying home.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Right Turn On Red",date:"20 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-20-right-turn-on-red/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Jagoda To Go",date:"22 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-22-jagoda-to-go/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Right Turn On Red",date:"20 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-20-right-turn-on-red/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.dangerousmeta.com\">dangerousmeta</a> In These Times <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/08/feature1.shtml\">Europe?s Right Turn</a> gets it wrong on several counts, at least in regards to Germany. September 11 and the war on terrorism has had virtually no effect on German politics. The SPD lost Hamburg on local issues, and the Schill 'Law and Order' Party is not overtly anti-immigrant. The NPD is not making political inroads anywhere, its political impact is nil. The losses of the Greens are not <i>despite</i> the pro-war Fischer, but <i>because</i> of him; he's undercutting the pacifist base. Stoiber is talking now as a national candidate much differently than he did as a state prime minister. He could make Euroskeptic noises when leading Bavaria, but not now as a national leader. He's not in the same boat as Haider. And eastern Germany is not particularly pro-Stoiber. Eastern voters tend to vote all over the map, and with only 18% of the vote, will not be a critical factor this fall.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"A Consortium of Committees",date:"20 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-20-a-consortium-of-committees/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Made It Through The Night",date:"21 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-21-made-it-through-the-night/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:923,pageCount:1101}}}});
