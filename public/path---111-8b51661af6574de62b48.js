The system had some startup glitches, but the repairman was there on Saturday to fix a broken sensor. Since I had the late shift on Saturday as my first day back, I was the lucky one to see if the system now worked.</p>\n<p>I was still a little groggy from jet lag when I came in last night, but I got a chip and the general instructions to activate the system (push star, wave the chip, push star again). If the green light comes on, the system is activated. If not, I have to double check all the doors and try again. OK, I think I got it. I go through the late shift, we come out at 5:15 am, and I do the star-chip-star thing. The green light blinks a few times and goes out.</p>\n<p>Is the alarm now active or not? I have no idea. I now wish I had been a little bit more attentive, for example whether the light was supposed to blink or stay on, and especially the part about deactivating the alarm. The phone number for the alarm company is in the store, I don't have it on me. If I go in and the alarm is active, lights and sirens go off and the police are on their way. Since I'm married to the boss, I decide to take the easy way out. I go home and wake her up.</p>\n<p>She's not thrilled, of course, but she calls in and sure enough, the alarm is not active. I go in again, check all the doors, and try again. Same thing happens. By now it's 6:15 am, the opening manager is going to be there in an hour anyway, and I decide to give up and go home to bed.</p>\n<p>This was not satisfactory for Frauke... she now has no idea whether the alarm system is still broken or whether her husband is just too dumb to use it. Or maybe noone told him that there is a status monitor in the office to check whether all the doors are locked. It turns out the door to the utility room (a separate room only accessible from outside) is unlocked. During the day it had been opened for, irony of ironies, the repairman from the alarm company. Once that door was locked, Frauke was able to activate the alarm... then she had to deactivate it again right away, since the opening manager had already arrived.</p>\n<p>And of course there's no indication from the outside whether the alarm is active or not... otherwise any thief could check the system himself before trying to break in. The trick is that a buzzer sounds if the activation was successful. Tonight I had night shift again... and this time the alarm worked. Don't say I'm not capable of learning from my mistakes.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Vacation Over",date:"11 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-11-vacation-over/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Two More Weeks",date:"20 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-20-two-more-weeks/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Vacation Over",date:"11 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-11-vacation-over/",tags:"Y2007"},html:"<p>Christopher and I arrived home yesterday after two weeks in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>* I only gained two pounds after two weeks of American food and relative inactivity. I was thrilled to be able to buy size 36 pants from Lands End after years of wearing size 38.</p>\n<p>* We managed to need only the same two suitcases for the flight back that we brought with us... one for toys (mostly Lego), one for everything else.</p>\n<p>* Christopher seemed to think that vacation meant also a vacation from changing clothes... including underwear. </p>\n<p>* I got to try out the new 20 inch iMac the day after they were announced. It's nice, but my boss would never let me buy one. :-)</p>\n<p>* Flying Icelandair from Frankfurt to Minneapolis was as pleasant as expected (no frills, but easy stopover at Keflavik). We both were even able to sleep some. Making the connection in Frankfurt was somewhat problematic, though. I would say getting from Terminal 1A to 2E in Frankfurt through construction with full luggage and a 7 year old qualifies as a level of Hell in Dante's Inferno.</p>\n<p>* Flying an overbooked and late Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Hamburg full of annoyed business people would also qualify. </p>\n<p>* We didn't go anywhere near the 35W bridge while in the Twin Cities, but our flight flew right over with an excellent view from above.</p>\n<p>* I get to work late shift tonight, just one day after flying in. I can't say I'm real excited about that, although with jet lag my personal clock is running late anyway. Frauke is taking the weekend off... her first days off since we took over in Dibbersen on July 1. I'll be working night shifts for the rest of Christopher's school vacation. That simplifies child care.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Iceland Sweater",date:"10 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-10-iceland-sweater/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Alarm Alarm",date:"13 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-13-alarm-alarm/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Iceland Sweater",date:"10 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-10-iceland-sweater/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/1074092998/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1264/1074092998_43710fbaac.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="CIMG0093.JPG" /></a></p>\n<p>At the duty-free shop at Keflavik airport, I found an Iceland sweater with a unique new technology that warms from both the inside and the outside simultaneously.
