And I also remember thinking back then that, from his timing of the war, President Bush was handing the fate of his re-election away from US voters and to the Iraqi people. If, say, in the summer of 2004 the occupation is going badly, the Iraqis do not feel liberated and \'better off than they were 4 years ago\', if US soldiers are still killing and being killed, Iraq would then dominate the US election and Bush would be like LBJ in 1968, namely toast.... Or, as <a title="BuzzMachine: Bye bye Bush?" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_08.html#004514">Buzz Machine</a> commented: \'The war was a success. But the peace is hell.\'"</p>\n<p>It looks like I was wrong about LBJ and toast, but the peace has turned out to be more hellish that I ever imagined.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Lantern March",date:"16 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-16-lantern-march/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Sticker Shock",date:"17 Oct 2004",slug:"/2004-10-17-sticker-shock/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:401,pageCount:1101}}}});
