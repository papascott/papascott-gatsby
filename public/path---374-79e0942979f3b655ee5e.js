For Christopher: "A child born to an American parent and a German parent acquires both American and German citizenship at birth, regardless of place of birth, if the parents satisfy the jus soli or jus sanguinis requirements of their respective countries...  Neither country requires a person born under these circumstances to choose between American and German citizenship, i.e., he/she may keep both citizenships his/her entire life."</p>\n<p>However, for his parents: "Under German law, a person may not have more than one citizenship unless he/she was born with both... Thus, German law requires an American who becomes a German citizen through the <em>Einb&uuml;rgerung</em> process to formally renounce his/her American citizenship, and a German who becomes an American citizen to give up his/her German citizenship."</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Stillstand",date:"27 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-27-stillstand/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Cardboard Train",date:"01 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-01-cardboard-train/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:374,pageCount:1101}}}});
