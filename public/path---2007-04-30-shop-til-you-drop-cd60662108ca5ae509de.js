Here in Niedersachsen the deregulation took effect this month, and our local Rewe supermarket is now open until 9:00 pm 6 days a week. We've taken advantage of the extra hour a few times already. </p>\n<p>When we came to Germany the restricted shopping hours was the biggest thing I had to get used to. Back then shops closed at 6:30 pm during the week and 2:00 pm on Saturday. But the times have become longer and longer, first until 8:00 pm on weekdays, and then 8:00 pm every Saturday. Now it's a non-issue, and I imagine that sooner or later Sunday closing will also be a thing of the past.</p>",fields:{title:"Shop Til You Drop",date:"30 Apr 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-04-30-shop-til-you-drop/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-04-30-shop-til-you-drop/",prev:{fields:{title:"Lead the World",date:"30 Apr 2007",slug:"/2007-04-30-lead-the-world/"}},next:{fields:{title:"09-F9-11-02-M-O-U-S-E",date:"02 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-02-09-f9-11-02-m-o-u-s-e/"}}}}}});
