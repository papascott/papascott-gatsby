The documentary by Irish filmmaker Jamie Doran is being shown on ARD tomorrow night. According to <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,227619,00.html">Spiegel Online</a>, the documentary has already aired in Britain and Italy, so it seems to be old news. So why does ARD deem it worthy of prime time? And why is the US State Dept complaining only now? Or did they protest the previous showings as well?</p>',fields:{title:"US fury over documentary",date:"17 Dec 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-12-17-us-fury-over-documentary/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-12-17-us-fury-over-documentary/",prev:{fields:{title:"Bad Dreams",date:"16 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-16-bad-dreams/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Stay After School",date:"18 Dec 2002",slug:"/2002-12-18-stay-after-school/"}}}}}});
