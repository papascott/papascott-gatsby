The German white stocking caps with the long earlappers looked silly, I thought. The Olympics are crassly commercial and nationalistic, of course, but there are far worse ways to vent off such things. Like <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/02/08">Hal</a>, I enjoyed the oversized animal puppets. Seeing the US hockey team light the flame reminded me of February 1980, when they won the gold medal, and I had just started seeing a German exchange student in the next town.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"I Need A Hug",date:"08 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-08-i-need-a-hug/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Schill To Take Drug Test",date:"09 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-09-schill-to-take-drug-test/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:929,pageCount:1101}}}});
