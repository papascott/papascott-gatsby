She doesn't even like using a remote control for her TV.</p>\n<p>We have a several old phones, so hardware is not a problem. I have a Motorola Timeport I picked up for &euro;3 from work. It seems to be the cell phone we have that looks the most like a normal phone. The menus are way too complicated, though. I wish I could disable everything except the phone book.

But this plan keeps a 6.5% payroll tax, while individuals pay 109 per month (but no more than 7% of income). So we keep the old bureaucracy, add a new one, and the difference gets paid with taxes. Nothing about cost reduction or efficiency. Everyone loses, except for high wage earners.
