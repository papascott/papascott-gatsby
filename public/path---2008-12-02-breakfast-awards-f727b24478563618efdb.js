Out of the 225 restaurants...</p>\n<p>* we placed 3rd in breakfast sales increase with 47.9%<br />\n* we placed 2nd in the marketing contest<br />\n* we placed in the top 20% (but not in the top 10) in McCaf&eacute; sales increase<br />\n* we were the only restaurant to place in the money in more than one contest and are therefore number one in cash and prizes (just like we won the jackpot at Wheel of Fortune... thank you,  Vanna!)</p>\n<p>The prize money will of course be paid out in full as bonus to our management and crew. We'll pay all payroll taxes, they'll receive the prize money as net pay... not that we are complaining.
