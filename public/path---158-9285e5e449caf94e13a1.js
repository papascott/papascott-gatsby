I'm not taking any medication, and we're trying to avoid surgery. I've been undergoing traction for my left hip and lower back, and taking acupuncture and TENS treatment for pain.</p>\n<p>After four weeks, I can see it's going to be a long haul. The pain relief has stagnated, and the past week I haven't been able to sleep through the night. The pain itself it dynamic, the intensity ebbs and wanes, and the epicenter seems to be moving upwards. I hope that's a sign of healing, that the pain is moving to it's true source in the spinal column. This weekend for the first time I felt discomfort in my back for the first time. Until now the pain has only been in my hip and legs. I'm fine when I standing, it's when sitting and laying down that the pain occurs. Waking up in the morning (or the middle of the night, as the case may be) it takes 30 minutes to an hour for the pain to subside.</p>\n<p>We'll continue the chiropractic traction treatments, they are what seem do the most good. I'm not sure about the acupuncture. I'm not sure TENS actually relieves pain or just distracts from it, but I guess on the whole it helps. I can see this is going to be a process of months and not weeks, and I'm glad our orthopedist is just a 5 minute drive. I'm also very glad I work at home... an hour drive twice a day would be pure torture.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"No Exception",date:"05 Feb 2007",slug:"/2007-02-05-no-exception/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Attitude",date:"06 Feb 2007",slug:"/2007-02-06-attitude/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"No Exception",date:"05 Feb 2007",slug:"/2007-02-05-no-exception/",tags:"Y2007"},html:"<p>In case anyone is wondering, I didn't watch the Super Bowl this year.

I could identify a lot with Christopher\'s experience. He also is learning letters phonetically, incorrect spelling is ignored for now, and he also has slippers at school. Unlike in the article, his class has a number (1c) not a name and he has to practice writing block letters like in the old days. His school has a \'family class\' with grades 1-4 in one room, but he\'s in a traditional class.</p>\n<p>I find learning reading phonetically to be fascinating. For example, their newest letter is \'H\', which is called "huh" (whisphered) and not "aitch" (or "haw" as it would be in German). They also learn gestures for each letter to associate with the sound. For \'H\' it is putting both hands in front of your mouth (as if you were blowing on your hands on a cold day). One day he and the neighbor girl were spelling words with gestures, and it looked like they were hula dancing. The phonetic system probably works only because the phonetics in German are consistent. I can\'t imagine learning English this way.</p>\n<p>Christopher is not into writing out words like the girl in the article. He\'s more into building and drawing. His career goal at the moment is to <a href="http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=vacant&amp;contentid=27719">design new figures for the Lego Group</a> (<a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/uploaded2583ca-5e05-4bd5-a003-ff36968c9bb8.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Report Card Vacation",date:"31 Jan 2007",slug:"/2007-01-31-report-card-vacation/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"No Exception",date:"05 Feb 2007",slug:"/2007-02-05-no-exception/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:158,pageCount:1101}}}});
