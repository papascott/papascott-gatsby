Last fall I wrote that I <a title="PapaScott: You May Be Right" href="http://www.papascott.de/2002/09/18/1886.php">wanted an AmphetaServer</a> instead of an AmphetaDesk. This looks it could be it. I\'ve been using feed on feeds all week now, and I love it. </p>\n<p>It\'s at version 0.1, and it looks and feels very clunky. I can think of a dozen ways to make it easier to use. It chokes on invalid XML. The layout is ugly. But the main thing is, it works. It gathers over 100 RSS feeds for me, which I can read and maintain from any browser, at home, at work, anywhere. It\'s now available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/feedonfeeds/">SourceForge</a>, and I look forward to watching, and maybe even helping, it develop.</p>\n<p><a title="Couchblog: Feed on feeds" href="http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/06/feed_on_feeds.php">Nico</a> saw the link as well, and feels pretty much the same way.</p>',fields:{title:"Feed on feeds",date:"06 Jun 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-06-06-feed-on-feeds/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-06-06-feed-on-feeds/",prev:{fields:{title:"Black blogs",date:"06 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-06-black-blogs/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Guardian corrects Wolfowitz 'sea of oil' article",date:"06 Jun 2003",slug:"/2003-06-06-guardian-corrects-wolfowitz-sea-of-oil-article/"}}}}}});
