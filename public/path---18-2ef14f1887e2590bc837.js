It has been over 3 months since my last blog post.</p>\n<p>And about the time of that last blog post I noticed that my weight and fitness were both leaving much to be desired. (I\'m sure my wife noticed long before I did, and I\'m sure she tried to let me know about it, and I\'m even more sure I did my best to ignore her.) My weight was brushing up to triple-figures in kilograms (that\'s 220 pounds in dog years), and that was my wake-up call.</p>\n<p>For the past couple of months I\'ve been trying to put myself first as far as diet and exercise go. Instead of just thinking about going to the gym, I actually went to the gym three times a week. As motivation I bought a Spotify subscription for my cell phone and a set of <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/backbeat-go">Plantronics BackBeat Go</a> wireless sport headphones (as <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013489.html">recommended by vowe</a>â€¦ with gadgets you can do much worse than to buy <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013739.html">what vowe keeps</a>).</p>\n<p>I also retook the <a href="http://www.myline24.de/">MyLine</a> nutrition course at our gym. Having taken it once before, it all sounded familiar and I was able to take more of it to heart than the first time. The first change they recommend is to eat 5 times a day. That\'s not as easy as it sounds. Avoiding alcohol is also a challenge. :-)</p>\n<p>But between the workouts and the nutrition and the positive motivation I was able to see results after two months. 6 kilos lost. Body fat reduced by nearly 3 percentage points. Waist and hips 3 cm smaller. Not bad for a guy who just turned 51.</p>\n<p>If you\'re doing the math, you\'ll know my weight is not yet ideal. (To help you calculate BMI, my height is 174 cm. As my trainer said, if I were 15 cm taller my weight would be ideal.) So\'ll I\'ll be sticking with the program for another 3 months.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, my next goal has been handed to me on a silver platter. Our business co-sponsors the local "<a href="http://www.buchholzerstadtlauf.de/">Stadtlauf</a>" (city run) in June, and the organizer told (not asked) my wife, "and your husband will run 5K this time". I\'ll take that as a challenge.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"More Blessed to Give",date:"29 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-29-more-blessed-to-give/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Salt of the Earth",date:"04 Apr 2013",slug:"/2013-04-04-salt-of-the-earth/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"More Blessed to Give",date:"29 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-29-more-blessed-to-give/",tags:"Y2012"},html:"<p>I'm not a particularly materialistic person. It's said that it is more blessed to give than to receive. If that's the case, then I had a particularly blessed Christmas. I've been blessed by a ratio of approximately 10 to 1.</p>\n<p>A part of this is due to the arrangement that my in-laws have with one another, to not arrange gifts among the adults, but only for the nieces and nephews and then with a strict price limit. In this arrangement everything is systematic and pre-arranged without any risk of surprise or forethought. The suggested gifts are specified to the last detail, usually accompanied by a ISBN number or an Amazon link. Those who have no specific wishes simply wish for iTunes gift cards. Larger suggestions can be combined among families or with Oma, with a complicated accounting of how the costs are shared and who pays whom for what.</p>\n<p>As you may know, our gift for Christopher this was a somewhat expensive musical instrument, a set of small pipes imported from Canada. My idea was that the in-laws could give a share of the instrument as their gift to Christopher: the set budget for Christmas and birthday would cover one-twelfth of the cost. I assumed this would be entered into the post-Christmas cost-of-gift accounting. But for some reason, perhaps because the small pipes did not have an item number at Amazon, the in-laws had all instead prepared envelopes with cash for Christopher. That was somewhat awkward as he already had gotten the pipes on Christmas Eve, so I had to snatch the cash from the cards. One of them had even pasted the bills with double-sides sticky pads to the card, which could only be removed with 10 minutes elbow grease and nail polish.</p>\n<p>For my gifts within the family I did my best to break the rules about avoiding surprise and forethought. For Christopher I found a couple of his favorite US groceries (Honey-Nut Cheerios!), for my wife some Brazilian jewelry and her specific wish for a bag for eyeglasses on her running belt (she lost a pair in the woods a couple of months ago; if you see a wild boar wearing bifocals you know who they belong to). For both I found a print of a hand-drawn map of London to remember our recent trip.</p>\n<p>I'll admit I'm being selective about counting gifts received. I'm not counting cash from the US (saves on shipping and I can pick out what I want), and I'm also not counting the colored sugar-and-spice calendar given to both my wife and me. I will also admit that the 50-year-old male is not the easiest to pick out presents for. I probably wouldn't know what to get myself.</p>\n<p>In the end my best and only present is a blue terry-cloth bathrobe. I already had a blue terry-cloth bathrobe, but it was 10 years old and my wife decided it was too ragged to look at anymore. The new robe is longer but not as warm. It will also be a constant reminder of how blessed I was this Christmas.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"The Good People and The Criminals",date:"18 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-18-the-good-people-and-the-criminals/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Back to the Grind",date:"02 Apr 2013",slug:"/2013-04-02-back-to-the-grind/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"The Good People and The Criminals",date:"18 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-18-the-good-people-and-the-criminals/",tags:"Y2012"},html:'<p>In the wake of the awful shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last week I\'ve been searching for the perfect words to say.

They are pretty much the most reasonable words I\'ve read so far, and with her permission I repeat them here...</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is something missing from the discussion about guns and violence and mass shootings going on this past week. The underlying assumptions about people. The "guns don\'t kill people, people do" folks assume there are two clear distinct groups of people: criminals and good people. If good people are armed, they can thwart the criminals. We can\'t "punish" the good people in our attempts to control criminals.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I reject that view of the world. We are all just people. We are all capable of being loving and caring. We are all capable of being selfish and fearful. We can all be overwhelmed by grief, terror and yes, even rage. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I readily confess to my darkness. I get pissed off while driving. I become too protective of the ones I love. I rage against the machine. I reach the end of my rope and become irrational. And when I do, the world is a safer place because I don\'t have a gun on my person. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I enjoy shooting. I really really do. And I have pretty decent aim. But I think we are all safer for me not having a gun on my person at all times. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>When does a "good person" who deserves to have a gun become a "criminal" who we need guns to stop?</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I maintain we are all a bit of both.</p></blockquote>'},next:{fields:{title:"Blue Light Special",date:"05 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-05-blue-light-special/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"More Blessed to Give",date:"29 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-29-more-blessed-to-give/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:18,pageCount:1101}}}});
