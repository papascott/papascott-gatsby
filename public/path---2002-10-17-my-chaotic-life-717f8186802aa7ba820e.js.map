Except this afternoon on the <em>Autobahn</em>, I hear a strange clunking from the back of my car just after the <em>Elbtunnel</em>.

It's stuck as if it were welded on.</p>\\n<p>Time to start getting creative. Call the auto club. Call Mama, who has Petra's number. Call Petra. Wait. Call Mama's sister-in-law to pick Christopher up... not home. Call Oma... she's home, and can pick him up. Call Petra to say Oma will pick up Christopher, and will even bring him to our house. A hour has gone by. Call auto club again, I'm next in line. Wait. There's the auto club car, but doesn't come to me He stops across the street! A guy there apparently called first. Wait half an hour for the auto club man to fix his Audi. </p>\\n<p>At 7 pm, 2 hours after my first call, the auto club car finally crosses the street to me. My wheel is rusted tight, says the auto club man. He pulls out a hammer and a piece of wood, and after about a dozen hits the wheel finally starts to budge.
