If a teacher is sick or doesn\'t show up for some reason, they send the kids home.</p>\n<p>In that sense we\'re lucky, Jesteburg has a <em><a href="http://www.gsjesteburg.de/konzept/aufsatz/en.html">Volle Halbtagsschule</a></em>, "full half-day school" (the link is even in English), which means the children aren\'t just supervised during empty hours, but are guaranteed to have 5 hours of instruction with certified teachers each day. The concept was tested in Lower Saxony in the \'90s, but was discontinued and replaced with the cheaper <em>verl&auml;ssliche Grundschule</em>. Our local school fought to keep their system and won.</p>\n<p>For first graders the school day is only 4 hours, though, mornings from 8 to 12. I\'m not sure if anyone would want to employ a sys admin who has to be home by noon every day. </p>',fields:{title:"Volle Halbtagsgrundschule",date:"25 Jan 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-01-25-volle-halbtagsgrundschule/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-01-25-volle-halbtagsgrundschule/",prev:{fields:{title:"Snowball Fight",date:"25 Jan 2006",slug:"/2006-01-25-snowball-fight/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Stumbling Blocks",date:"27 Jan 2006",slug:"/2006-01-27-stumbling-blocks/"}}}}}});
