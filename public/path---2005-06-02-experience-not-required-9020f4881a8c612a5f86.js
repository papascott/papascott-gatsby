I don\'t mean her seat in the Bundestag, I mean to an office where she actually leads a campaign and runs a government, for instance as a mayor or state premier. Leading German politicians have generally cut their teeth at the state level. In fact, I couldn\'t think of German chancellor candidate who didn\'t have such experience... I had to turn to Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>My first guess was <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Jochen_Vogel">Hans-Jochen Vogel</a> in 1983, but I was wrong. I knew he had been mayor of Munich, but he was also mayor of Berlin... only for 6 months, but Berlin is a state so that counts. The last chancellor candidate without any experience running a state was <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Barzel">Rainer Barzel</a>, who lost to Willy Brandt in 1972. The only German Chancellor who, like Merkel, had never been mayor or state premier was<br />\n<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Erhard">Ludwig Erhard</a>, not a particularly good Chancellor who lasted just 3 years. </p>\n<p>Merkel has done well leading the CDU, taming Stoiber and Koch, but does she actually have the experience to run an election and lead a country?</p>',fields:{title:"Experience Not Required",date:"02 Jun 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-06-02-experience-not-required/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-06-02-experience-not-required/",prev:{fields:{title:"Wishful Thinking",date:"29 May 2005",slug:"/2005-05-29-wishful-thinking/"}},next:{fields:{title:"I Love Berlin",date:"04 Jun 2005",slug:"/2005-06-04-i-love-berlin/"}}}}}});
