So we close the drive-thru at 1 during the week and at 4 on weekends. But now our restaurant manager has convinced us that on weekends the potential is there, and presented us with a staffing concept to stay open all night Friday and Saturday with no additional labor costs. So we\'re going for it! Starting the first weekend in May, our drive-thru will stay open all night on Friday and Saturday. Even if we only break even, the advertising potential will be worth the effort</p>',fields:{title:"Open All Night",date:"08 Apr 2008",url:"https://papascott.de/2008-04-08-open-all-night/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2008-04-08-open-all-night/",prev:{fields:{title:"Black and White",date:"08 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-08-black-and-white/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Convention Postcard",date:"19 Apr 2008",slug:"/2008-04-19-convention-postcard/"}}}}}});
