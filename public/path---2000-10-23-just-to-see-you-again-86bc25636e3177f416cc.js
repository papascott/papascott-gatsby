The doctors are unhappy with his blood values, but he's slowly getting better. </p>\n<p>Mama is hanging in there too. She's been with him pretty much 24/7 since he was admitted on Saturday. </p>\n<hr />\nMaricopa County (Arizona) was kind enough spend $21 to send my absentee ballot by Express Mail.
