September 11 and the war on terrorism has had virtually no effect on German politics. The SPD lost Hamburg on local issues, and the Schill 'Law and Order' Party is not overtly anti-immigrant. The NPD is not making political inroads anywhere, its political impact is nil. The losses of the Greens are not <i>despite</i> the pro-war Fischer, but <i>because</i> of him; he's undercutting the pacifist base. Stoiber is talking now as a national candidate much differently than he did as a state prime minister. He could make Euroskeptic noises when leading Bavaria, but not now as a national leader. He's not in the same boat as Haider. And eastern Germany is not particularly pro-Stoiber. Eastern voters tend to vote all over the map, and with only 18% of the vote, will not be a critical factor this fall.</p>",fields:{title:"Right Turn On Red",date:"20 Feb 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-02-20-right-turn-on-red/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-02-20-right-turn-on-red/",prev:{fields:{title:"A Consortium of Committees",date:"20 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-20-a-consortium-of-committees/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Made It Through The Night",date:"21 Feb 2002",slug:"/2002-02-21-made-it-through-the-night/"}}}}}});
