"(W)ords that we borrowed wholesale (from Latin)... are generally problematic, as it\'s difficult to tell (without simply listing them) which ones follow Latin rules and which do not. For instance, the plural of "radius" is "radii", but the plural of "genius" is "geniuses". "Consortium" becomes "consortia", but "premium" becomes "premiums". English sucks."
