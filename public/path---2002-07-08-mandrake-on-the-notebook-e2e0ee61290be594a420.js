The notebook would purr lovingly when I put the other card in my FreeBSD workstation, but stubbornly refused to talk to Linux. Since I just want the thing to work, I gave up and put Mandrake 8.2 on the notebook. It's what we use at work, so I can keep updated, and it took just 2 tries to get online. I'm still not completely wireless, since the battery is still shot, but I can get that repaired or replaced. And there's a power outlet on the patio. And the weather is supposed to get better.</p>",fields:{title:"Mandrake On The Notebook",date:"08 Jul 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-07-08-mandrake-on-the-notebook/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-07-08-mandrake-on-the-notebook/",prev:{fields:{title:"Apple.de?",date:"08 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-08-applede/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Seconds To Decide",date:"08 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-08-seconds-to-decide/"}}}}}});
