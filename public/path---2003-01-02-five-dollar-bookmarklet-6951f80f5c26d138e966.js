While hacking the MT bookmarklet is a cool idea, and it\'s handy to know where to do it, it\'s not really what I had in mind. Of course, I didn\'t really say what I had in mind. I just made a throwaway cute comment about a two-bit bookmarklet not expecting anyone to take it seriously. </p>\n<p>However, if I were designing the million dollar authoring app, off the top of my head, I would expect it to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>warn me if I were submitting invalid HTML</li>\n<li>suggest tags and attributes that my post may be missing</li>\n<li>allow me to drag and drop links into my post</li>\n<li>check if the links are on my blogroll, and allow me to add them if they are not</li>\n<li>check if the links have RSS feeds, and if so allow me to add them to my aggregator</li>\n<li>run with the browser and OS of my choice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\'s what I was thinking of when I said that a bookmarklet wasn\'t up to the job. Maybe <a title="Ranchero Software: NetNewsWire Pro 1.0b4" href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/">NetNewsWire Pro</a>, a news aggregator with posting capability, will become something like this, or <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> can be scripted to do it, or maybe it will be an <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mozilla/">XUL app for Mozilla</a>. Or maybe I\'m just dreaming. I don\'t know.</p>',fields:{title:"Five Dollar Bookmarklet",date:"02 Jan 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-01-02-five-dollar-bookmarklet/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-01-02-five-dollar-bookmarklet/",prev:{fields:{title:"Quiet Day",date:"01 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-01-quiet-day/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Grounded By Stupidity",date:"02 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-02-grounded-by-stupidity/"}}}}}});
