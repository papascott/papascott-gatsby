The principle is however the same. The low-oil-volume vat holds just half the volume of a traditional fryer, so we only have to heat half as much oil. To maintain the quality of the oil, the fryer automatically filters the vat after 12 cooking cycles (normally a vat is filtered once daily), and tops itself off when the vat starts to run low.</p>\n<p>Think of the fryer as just like a hybrid car... the tank is smaller and we have to fill it less often, so we save energy and money. We\'re looking for both good performance and good gas (er, I mean oil) mileage.</p>',fields:{title:"Hybrid Fryer",date:"27 May 2009",url:"https://papascott.de/2009-05-27-hybrid-fryer/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2009-05-27-hybrid-fryer/",prev:{fields:{title:"Rustic furniture",date:"13 May 2009",slug:"/2009-05-13-rustic-furniture/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Spur of the Moment",date:"27 May 2009",slug:"/2009-05-27-spur-of-the-moment/"}}}}}});
