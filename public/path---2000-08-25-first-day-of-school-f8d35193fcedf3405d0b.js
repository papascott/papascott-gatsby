The festivities begin with a church service at 9 am, and continue through to the obligatory coffee and cake in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p>The net result is that even the not-so-interested spouse of the godmother has to block out an entire Saturday from his calendar.</p>\n<p>When I started first grade, I might have gotten an apple, but probably not.
