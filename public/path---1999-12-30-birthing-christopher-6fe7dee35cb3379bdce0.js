Participating in the birth was more difficult psychologically than I ever imagined. I saw my wife suffering so badly at a fairly early stage of labor, and I knew the pain would only get worse before it would get better. I had no idea how to comfort her, much less how to deal with it myself!</i></p>\n<p>With Mama due on the 27th, we made sure not to make any fixed plans<br />\nover the holidays. At least, I thought we made sure. My wife forgot,<br />\nand invited her mother to stay overnight from the 25th to the<br />\n26th. \"But we might have to suddenly leave for the clinic,\" my wife explained to her mother. \"So you might have to find your own way to the train<br />\nstation.\" But she didn't really believe that anything would happen.</p>\n<p>But sure enough, my wife woke up at midnight feeling uncomfortable, and<br />\nstarted feeling contractions at 3 am. She didn't wake me up until 6<br />\nam, since the contractions were weak and 20 minutes apart. We knew<br />\nthat things wouldn't be serious until they were 5 minutes apart or the<br />\nwater broke, so we weren't yet too concerned. We went ahead with our<br />\nChristmas dinner plans, roasted goose legs from Poland, with red<br />\ncabbage and potatoes. After all , the goose legs were already thawed<br />\nout, and had to be cooked that day.</p>\n<p>However, just as the goose legs came out of the oven, the water<br />\nbroke. It didn't come rushing out, though, and the contractions were<br />\nstill 15 minutes apart and fairly weak. My wife called her midwife, who<br />\nsaid not to be concerned yet as long as she was feeling well. We<br />\nwent ahead with dinner.</p>\n<p>However, after dinner, at 2:30 pm, the water started flowing more<br />\nstrongly, and my wife was not feeling good any longer. \"We are going to<br />\nthe hospital... NOW.\" So we did, and my mother-in-law had to find her<br />\nown way to the train station after all.</p>\n<p>It had started to snow (northern Germany was catching the edge of the<br />\nbig storm that caused so much damage in France), so driving to the<br />\nhospital was pretty slow. At the hospital, they attached a CTG (fetal<br />\nheart monitor) for 30 minutes (contractions now 8 minutes apart),<br />\nperformed an ultrasound, told us we had a ways to go yet and that the<br />\nsize of the baby could cause difficulties, and had us fill out<br />\npaperwork, move into a room, and come back in a couple of hours, at<br />\n7:30. Then it was back on the CTG. The contractions were now 5 minutes<br />\napart and getting uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>We then moved into a delivery prep area, where in theory my wife could<br />\nrelax and take a bath, which would make the contractions more<br />\ncomfortable. In fact, they became totally unbearable, in every<br />\nposition, and in the bath they felt worse. The cervix was only dilated<br />\n3 cm... it needs to be 10 cm to deliver, so things would only get<br />\nworse.</p>\n<p>We hadn't really discussed pain medication beforehand, except that<br />\nwe'd try to get by without if we could. Obviously, at this point all<br />\nbets were off, and she requested a PDA... anesthetic injected near<br />\nthe spinal cord, the strongest type of pain medication available for<br />\nnormal delivery.</p>\n<p>However, the PDA meant the birth became a very clinical procedure. It<br />\nwas applied by an anesthetist, an IV was needed to regulate blood<br />\npressure, a CGT was then permanently attached, and labor-inducing<br />\nmedication were administered to keep the contractions going. We even had<br />\nto sign a release between contractions, but by 11 pm the PDA was in<br />\nplace, and my wife was in peace. The PDA would last for 2 hours...</p>\n<p>In theory, anyway. In fact, the pains returned after only an<br />\nhour. Even worse, the anesthetist was no longer available to reapply<br />\nthe PDA (that snowstorm had caused a number of accidents)... only at<br />\n1:30 am did someone arrive to refill the anesthetic. If they hadn't<br />\narrived, a Cesarean section would have been unavoidable, as my wife had<br />\nno strength left at all, and her cervix was only at 8 cm.</p>\n<p>With the second PDA, though, she was able to even sleep for about<br />\nan hour and the cervix was able to dilate fully before she had to start pressing. However, the size of the baby was causing problems. The head was just too large to pass into the birth canal. The doctor was signalling that they could start a Cesarean, but the midwife insisted that my wife was making progress.</p>\n<p>The midwife was right. At 3:15, the head was far enough down so that a<br />\nvacuum extractor (an alternative to forceps commonly used in Europe)<br />\ncould be used to complete delivery. One doctor pounded on my wife's<br />\nstomach, the other pulled on the extractor, and at 3:39 am Christopher, all wet and sloppy, was laying on her stomach.</p>\n<p><em> This story from my old weblog was copied into Movable Type on 17 August 2003</em></p>",fields:{title:"Birthing Christopher",date:"30 Dec 1999",url:"https://papascott.de/1999-12-30-birthing-christopher/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/1999-12-30-birthing-christopher/",prev:{fields:{title:"Christopher Ryan Hanson",date:"29 Dec 1999",slug:"/1999-12-29-christopher-ryan-hanson/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Christopher Ryan Hanson",date:"30 Dec 1999",slug:"/1999-12-30-christopher-ryan-hanson/"}}}}}});
