He is now free to play a national role in the CDU. By \'pulling a Stoiber\' in Hamburg, von Beust must now be mentioned in the same breath as CDU stars like Koch and Wulff.</p>\n<p>And a new moderate CDU star strengthens Merkel\'s hand against the Lederhosen wing of the Union. I doubt that Stoiber will throw in the towel and move to Bellevue (i.e. accept the office of Bundespresident, removing him from political influence), but I do believe that the Union will take more moderate positions on issues like immigration and tax reform, and that this makes Merkel even more likely to be the next chancellor candidate.</p>\n<p>(Lightly ediited from a comment posted at <a title="Davids Medienkritik: German Socialists Suffer Crushing Election Loss in Hamburg" href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/german_socialis.html">Medienkritik</a>.)</p>',fields:{title:"The Meaning of Hamburg",date:"01 Mar 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-03-01-the-meaning-of-hamburg/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-03-01-the-meaning-of-hamburg/",prev:{fields:{title:"Russell Beattie: Looking back at Spain",date:"01 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-01-russell-beattie-looking-back-at-spain/"}},next:{fields:{title:"",date:"02 Mar 2004",slug:"/2004-03-02-httpwwwsueddeutschede/"}}}}}});
