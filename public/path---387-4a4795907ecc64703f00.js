That\'s sweet coming from a politican who had his country perform an instant about-face on Iraq upon his election. If foreign issues are resolved more on the basis of party politics rather than national interest, how can te EU of 25 have any sort of coherent foreign policy at all? Right now the EU <em>might</em> be able to agree that the Earth is round and rotates around the sun, but only if Italy abstains. <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/041106120808.wl2psr92" title="EUbusiness - EU can become global power in 20 years: Spanish PM">(EUbusiness - EU can become global power in 20 years: Spanish PM)</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Firefox not ready",date:"08 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-08-firefox-not-ready/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Happy Cadaver Day",date:"08 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-08-happy-cadaver-day/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Firefox not ready",date:"08 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-08-firefox-not-ready/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>Like <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/2004/11/08/firefox-09-forever/" title="">Susan</a>, I haven\'t been real happy lately with Firefox, which is supposed to release 1.0 tomorrow. The release candidates for the Mac have been somewhat stable, but are still worse than 0.9.x. And they stil render certain GIFs improperly, like PhotoMatt\'s header and the star images at Amazon, at least for me. And under Linux, Firefox chokes, and sometimes freezes, on mistyped hostnames with slow DNS lookups. Maybe it works better on Windows, but I fear the <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/4891">hype</a> is going to backfire.
