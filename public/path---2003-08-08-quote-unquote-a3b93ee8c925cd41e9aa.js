How <a title="Das E-Business Weblog: Mal wieder: Zum Zitieren in Blogs" href="http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/08/07/mal_wieder_zum_zitieren_in_blogs.shtml">should</a> bloggers <a title="Couchblog: Hunde die bellen" href="http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/08/hunde_die_bellen.php">quote</a> one another? <a title="Das E-Business Weblog: Mal wieder: Zum Zitieren in Blogs" href="http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/08/07/mal_wieder_zum_zitieren_in_blogs.shtml">Should</a> a quote be immediately identifiable as a quote? <a title="Das E-Business Weblog: Mal wieder: Zum Zitieren in Blogs" href="http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/08/07/mal_wieder_zum_zitieren_in_blogs.shtml">Should</a> a link always be permalink?</p>\n<p>I personally bristle at any rules that bloggers \'must\' or \'should\' do anything, except be true to their own principles and to themselves. I don\'t blog to share knowledge. I don\'t blog to be part of a community. I blog for myself, for my own enjoyment. I don\'t have an obligation to follow any rules with my weblog, except to please me. So <a title="Scripting News" href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> is free to edit his posts during the day. <a title="Der Schockwellenreiter" href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">Jörg Kantel</a> is free to quote without attribution. (Although once you read his blog for a few days, it\'s pretty easy to pick out his words from the quotes, even without the quotation marks. And for all I know, maybe he didn\'t even invent his catch phrase <a title="Google Search: "Allerschärfstes Willkommen"" href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22Allersch%E4rfstes Willkommen%22&btnG=Google Search">"Allerschärfstes Willkommen".) And I\'m free to quote and paraphrase in my Quick Links to get things to fit in the tool tip bar.</p>\n<p>And those who blog seriously, professionally, for business, or as consultants, just have to accept weblogs for what they are, namely mostly unserious and unprofessional. You might as well try to herd cats.</p>\n<p><b>Update</b> It\'s appropriate to add a quote here, from <a title="Jonathon Delacour: Weblog Ethics" href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2003/08/weblog_ethics.php">Jonathon Delacour</a> (welcome back, by the way), in regards to ethics and blogging: "I instinctively mistrust attempts... to impose rules or standards, no matter how well-intentioned they might be."</p>',fields:{title:"Quote Unquote",date:"08 Aug 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-08-08-quote-unquote/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-08-08-quote-unquote/",prev:{fields:{title:"Elite Force Aviator: George W.
