Management finally presented a concrete proposal for salary reductions (retroactive to July 1). The reductions are to be progressive (rather than a flat 15%)  and require 75% acceptance to take effect.

So I\'ll vote to reject the plan. If that means layoffs, even for me, then so be it.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I\'ve decided to stay with the company (rather than work elsewhere or go freelance) at least until the end of the year.
