We haven\'t had a "wartime president" since FDR, and there\'s a good reason for that: you\'re only a wartime president if you act like you\'re at war. That means placing the country on a wartime footing, putting aside petty politics to forge a bipartisan wartime consensus, and telling the nation in no uncertain terms that sacrifices need to be made. George Bush has done none of those things."</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Forty-two",date:"09 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-09-forty-two/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"PapaScott Sells Out",date:"10 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-10-papascott-sells-out/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Forty-two",date:"09 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-09-forty-two/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>If <a title="Google Search: answer to life, the universe and everything" href="http://www.google.com/search?&q=answer to life%2C the universe and everything">42 is the answer</a>, then <a href="/2000/02/09" title="Today">what</a> <a href="/2001/02/09" title="is">is</a> <a href="/2002/02/09" title="my">the</a> <a href="/2003/02/09" title="birthday">question</a>?</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"The Color Thing",date:"08 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-08-the-color-thing/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Blood, Sweat and Tears",date:"10 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-10-blood-sweat-and-tears/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"The Color Thing",date:"08 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-08-the-color-thing/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="One State, Two State, Red State, Blue State" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/weekinreview/08zell.html?ex=1391576400&en=5a0729b3dc8ebe5f&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">One State, Two State, Red State, Blue State</a> I guess I missed this Republican are red, Democrats are blue meme. Here in Germany the parties have colors, too, but red is left. We have the red/green coalition, both Union parties are black, the Free Democrats are yellow (in color, not necessarily in courage), any far-right parties are brown, and the Democratic Socialists are red (in the "better dead than red" sense).
