Or at least he intends to. I guess the real question is, will President Bush bother to pick up the phone when he sees who is calling? </p>\n<p><b>Update</b> Here\'s a quick English summary of the Spiegel article: <b>Schröder wants to congratulate Bush, in spite of everything.</b> Schröder\'s press secretary announced that Schröder wanted to congratulate Bush as soon as the final results are in. He didn\'t want to speculate whether Bush would belatedly congratulate Schröder on his victory in September. "Of course the Chancellor will congratulate the President in the appropriate way." The Foreign Office explained that the Republican victory would have no effect on relations with the US.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Deep Dark Links",date:"06 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-06-deep-dark-links/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"English Week",date:"07 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-07-english-week/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Deep Dark Links",date:"06 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-06-deep-dark-links/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>OK, 60% of the vote has been counted, and Mondale hasn't quite lost the Minnesota Senate race yet, so I still have time to tell my Mondale story.

My job was to listen to police radio and wake up a photographer if anything interesting happened. (Note that I was not to wake up a reporter. Words can be written after the fact.) Anyway, one boring night I was looking through the desk drawer, and discovered hundreds of xeroxed address labels, all with the same address. Walter Mondale's law firm in Washington. I have no idea what the news room was regularly sending to Walter Mondale... it certainly wasn't his newspaper subscription. I imagine there was some deep dark link between the paper and the politician. I have a vivid imagination.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Website Boy",date:"05 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-05-website-boy/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"",date:"06 Nov 2002",slug:"/2002-11-06-schroeder-congratulates-bush/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:820,pageCount:1101}}}});
