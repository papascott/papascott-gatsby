My great-uncle who told the story has since passed away, and among his effects was a newspaper article about <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/bios/aarvik.html">Egil Aarvig</a> (1912-1990), Norwegian politician, newspaper editor and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. My grandmother\'s maiden name was Aakvik, so it could very well be that we are related to the late Norwegian politician. Whether he had married into the royal family is yet unclear.</p>',fields:{title:"Egil Aarvik",date:"16 Jun 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-06-16-egil-aarvik/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-06-16-egil-aarvik/",prev:{fields:{title:"Tip Me Not",date:"15 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-15-tip-me-not/"}},next:{fields:{title:"PS: Mena Loves You",date:"16 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-16-ps-mena-loves-you/"}}}}}});
