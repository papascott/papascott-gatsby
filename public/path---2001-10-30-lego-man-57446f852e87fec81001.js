Six months ago he was happy (and his parents proud) to be able to stack 6 or 8 pieces into a straight block, no corners sticking out.

We were in Minneapolis at that time; the club he mentions is <a href="http://www.first-avenue.com">1st Avenue</a> (not 7th Avenue, as I originally wrote), where much of Purple Rain was filmed and of which Prince was rumored to be part owner. I never saw him there, though, but I did see the Ramones 3 times there.</p>',fields:{title:"Lego Man",date:"30 Oct 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-10-30-lego-man/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-10-30-lego-man/",prev:{fields:{title:"It Takes Two",date:"29 Oct 2001",slug:"/2001-10-29-it-takes-two/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Get 'Em Next Time",date:"31 Oct 2001",slug:"/2001-10-31-get-em-next-time/"}}}}}});
