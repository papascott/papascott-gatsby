It\'s going to take a while for me to learn digital video. Maybe I need a \'Dummies\' book. <b>Later:</b> It worked! Christopher\'s grandparents were able to view the video.</p>\n<p><b>Helping out family in Minnesota</b></p>\n<p>My mother writes (I\'ve removed the names): "Dad has been very busy this past week.  His sister-in-law\'s brother had a heart attack about a month ago so was unable to plant his crops.  He has about a 1000 acres.  Dad, two of his brothers along with a couple of neighbors and a son got going on Wed. and Thurs. and it sounded like they would finish up Friday. I think they meant all of it.  Then after a few weeks, the neighbor will spray for weeds and then they are set till harvest."</p>\n<p><b>And finally in soccer</b></p>\n<p>Hamburg\'s inner-city team <a href="http://www.fcstpauli.de">FC St. Pauli</a> has promoted to the Bundesliga 1st league for the 4th in 12 years (which means they\'ve been demoted to the 2nd league 3 times in that same time period).  I imagine that in a year or two they\'ll be back in the 2nd league, but it will be fun to have them in the big league for a while, if nothing else than to watch overpaid teams like Bayern Munich play in their dinky neighborhood stadium.</p>',fields:{title:"In The Bath",date:"20 May 2001",url:"https://papascott.de/2001-05-20-in-the-bath/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2001-05-20-in-the-bath/",prev:{fields:{title:"The Mug Game",date:"19 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-19-the-mug-game/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Change of Channels",date:"21 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-21-change-of-channels/"}}}}}});
