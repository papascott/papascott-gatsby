I\'ll ask <a href="http://live.curry.com">Adam</a> if he thinks the stories there are any good. </p>\n<p>I\'m also surprised not to have seen any comparisons of Fortuyn with Germany\'s political maverick, Hamburg\'s Interior Senator "Judge Merciless" Ronald Schill. They have a number of surface similarities: both are celebrities new to politics, right of center without being radical right, founding parties that bear their names. However, Schill\'s celebrity is local to Hamburg, and his law-and-order platform is tailored for urban voters. Although his party pulled 4% in Sachsen-Anhalt last month, he doesn\'t have national ambitions, at least not for this year (he\'s supporting Stoiber). And Schill is nowhere near as charismatic as Fortuyn.</p>\n<p>(The <a href="http://www.schill-partei.de/">Schill Party website</a> is in German only, but it does have a picture of the good judge, and you can decide for yourself whether he would look any better with a Pim Fortuyn haircut.)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"In Front Of The Paris",date:"12 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-12-in-front-of-the-paris/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"IQ Haiku",date:"13 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-13-iq-haiku/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"In Front Of The Paris",date:"12 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-12-in-front-of-the-paris/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p><a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$1268"><img alt="Link to Hal and Scott in LV" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/05/halandsmh.jpg" width="100" height="75" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/05/11">Hal</a> has put up a picture of us from our evening a couple weeks ago.
