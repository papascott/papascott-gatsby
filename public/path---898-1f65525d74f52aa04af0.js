Instead she has a lot of lonely travel and is somewhat jaded on the company. Our other friend has worked for 3 different oil/convenience store companies in the past year without changing her desk. But she's happy. We all went to a D-Backs game our last night. We had fun, and they won.</p>\n<p>LAX sucks for catching connections, especially with a stroller. To switch terminals, you have to go outside and wait for a crowded non-accessable bus. FRA was almost as bad; no bus, but a maze of twisty tunnels, all alike.
