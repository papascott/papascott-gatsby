That\'s why Mama is working late tonight (although I\'m not sure what she can do, buy a fleet of armored cars on EBay?).</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here\'s a good one: deposits that were picked up by Heros over the weekend are being held pending the bankruptcy settlement. So that money you thought was in the bank on Monday actually isn\'t.
