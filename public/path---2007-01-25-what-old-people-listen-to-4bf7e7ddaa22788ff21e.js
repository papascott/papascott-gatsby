I decided both "best" and "important" were uninteresting (and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/500albums">best</a> has already been done). I decided to list "favorite" instead, albums I like and listen to, even though they may not be the best, and maybe next week my list would be different. I did limit myself to one pick per artist. In order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dirty Mind, Prince</li>\n<li>Rocket to Russia, Ramones</li>\n<li>Born to Run, Bruce Springsteen</li>\n<li>London Calling, The Clash</li>\n<li>Making Movies, Dire Straits</li>\n<li>Achtung Baby, U2</li>\n<li>Talk Show, Go-Go\'s</li>\n<li>Planet Punk, Die Ã„rzte</li>\n<li>So, Peter Gabriel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He listed nine, so I did too (though the 9th was the hardest to pick). For the moment I won\'t explain my choices, maybe later. Feel free to tell me in the comments why my picks suck.</p>',fields:{title:"What Old People Listen To",date:"25 Jan 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-01-25-what-old-people-listen-to/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-01-25-what-old-people-listen-to/",prev:{fields:{title:"Linux Can Be Dangerous",date:"25 Jan 2007",slug:"/2007-01-25-linux-can-be-dangerous/"}},next:{fields:{title:"One Good Thing About Germany",date:"26 Jan 2007",slug:"/2007-01-26-one-good-thing-about-germany/"}}}}}});
