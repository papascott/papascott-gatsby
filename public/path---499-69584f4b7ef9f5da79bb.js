So now I think I <a title="[Samba] PDC migration from samba-tng to samba 3" href="http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2004-April/083728.html">know</a> what went wrong with our first attempt. Samba calculates the SID for each user dynamically, and samba-tng uses a different formula than samba 3. For users to continue to work after switching to samba 3, their SIDs must be explicitly set to the old values. Since smbpasswd does not store SIDS, the user information has to be stored in a database, preferably ldap, but for our small network tdbsam will suffice.</p>\n<p>Almost as an aside, I also <a title="[Samba] Re: Group mapping: several unix groups to one Windows group?" href="http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2004-April/083765.html">found out</a> that I was mapping the unix groups incorrectly. So will the switch to samba 3 now work? We can test ahead of time, but we will only know for sure when we go live.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Marketing is everything",date:"04 Apr 2004",slug:"/2004-04-04-marketing-is-everything/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Wet memories",date:"04 Apr 2004",slug:"/2004-04-04-wet-memories/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Marketing is everything",date:"04 Apr 2004",slug:"/2004-04-04-marketing-is-everything/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>Christopher has always refused to wear jeans or canvas pants, preferring either overalls or (now that he can go to the toilet by himself) sweat pants.
