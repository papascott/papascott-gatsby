He mentions a report from the <a title="USA stoppen Investitionen in ihre deutschen StÃ¼tzpunkte" href="http://www.wams.de/data/2003/02/09/40345.html">Welt am Sonntag</a> that the US Dept of Defense has halted investment at US bases in Germany, in particular planned construction at the air bases at Ramstein and Sprangdahlen. A hospital planned for Sprangdahlen will likely be built in Hungary.</p>\n<p>Even if relations were currently good between Germany and the US, I wouldn\'t regard moving bases to the east a bad thing. The new NATO members are closer to potential action and can use the help more than the rich Germans. It might give a new purpose to NATO which currently seems directionless, which right now can\'t even decide how to come to the aid of Turkey in the event of war.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I live in the former British Occupation Zone, and therefore my local economy would not be affected one iota by an American pullout.</p>',fields:{title:"Moving the Chips Eastward",date:"09 Feb 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-02-09-moving-the-chips-eastward/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-02-09-moving-the-chips-eastward/",prev:{fields:{title:"Forty-One",date:"09 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-09-forty-one/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Guillaume Affair",date:"10 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-10-guillaume-affair/"}}}}}});
