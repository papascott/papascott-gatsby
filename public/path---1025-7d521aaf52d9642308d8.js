I was able to get some work done, mostly because I was up at 5 and Christopher slept in until 10:30.</p>\n<p>Today was also Mama's meeting with her new Ãœberboss, the meeting she has been preparing for the past three weeks. She thought that he would have doubts about putting a young mother in a position of responsibility, but the meeting went well. And all the signals she is receiving this week are positive. And, most importantly, she wants the responsibility and is confident that she can handle it.</p>\n<p>As for me, I placed my trust in her ability when we came to Germany 10 years ago. I knew she would be successful, and I was right, and I got to tag along. (It's not like I'm extra baggage, though; in that time I've learned German and established a career.) Now, of course, we two have become we three, and the stakes are now higher. But I know she will be successful, and this time Christopher and I get to tag along together. </p>\n<p>Anyway, we'll see what happens in about 6 weeks. In the meantime, we can finally start our normal routine next week, so that we each spend a weekday home with Christopher, instead of just me.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Catch as Catch Can",date:"15 Jan 2001",slug:"/2001-01-15-catch-as-catch-can/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"On Our Way Out the Door",date:"20 Jan 2001",slug:"/2001-01-20-on-our-way-out-the-door/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Catch as Catch Can",date:"15 Jan 2001",slug:"/2001-01-15-catch-as-catch-can/",tags:"Y2001"},html:"<p><img src=\"http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/01/crh150101.jpg\" height=\"188\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\" alt=\"crh150101.jpg: \" /></p>\n<p>All-Star Bobby Car Wrestling!

The price was a little less than she wanted, but I've got the big brown bills laying next to me as I type this. </p>\n<p>Mama took 'store tours' both Saturday and Sunday, so I spent the weekend (as well as my usual work-at-home Monday) with Christopher. He's been suffering from what can be most delicately referred to as 'loose stool'. Let's just say I've been eaching into it up to my elbows. We've been doing 2 to 3 'complete changes' a day, and just now we took an impromptu bath rather than deal with the situation normally. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the work I'm supposedly doing at home today has lain mostly untouched.</p>\n<p><b>PS:</b> Thanks, \"andrea\" for the good wishes. Christopher isn't really sick. He may be just teething. Our 'Kinderarzt\" assures us that despite our frequent visits, Christopher is very healthy and isn't sick any more often than other kids his age.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Letter Home",date:"13 Jan 2001",slug:"/2001-01-13-letter-home/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"End of the Day",date:"19 Jan 2001",slug:"/2001-01-19-end-of-the-day/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:1025,pageCount:1101}}}});
