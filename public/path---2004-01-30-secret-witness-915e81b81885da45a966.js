Zakeri, who claims also to have worked for the CIA and the German BND, could only say that he heard from an unidentified Iranian official that Mzoudi was among the 9/11 plotters. Hearsay from an unreliable witness. Mzoudi is almost certain to acquitted when the verdict is announced, now scheduled for next Thursday, unless the prosecution finds another secret witness.</p>',fields:{title:"Secret Witness",date:"30 Jan 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-01-30-secret-witness/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-01-30-secret-witness/",prev:{fields:{title:"Kind robots, indeed.",date:"30 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-30-kind-robots-indeed/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Senseless violence",date:"30 Jan 2004",slug:"/2004-01-30-senseless-violence/"}}}}}});
