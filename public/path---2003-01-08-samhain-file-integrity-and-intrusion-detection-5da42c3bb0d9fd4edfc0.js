It can probably brew coffee, too, but I haven\'t found it in the docs yet. The configuration is a bit complicated, but it looks promising. </p>\n<p>The idea of a file integrity system is not to prevent hackers (or rogue employees) from attacking a system, but to be quickly aware of an attack before the attacker has a chance to cover his tracks. It involves keeping cryptographic signatures of important files so that changes can be detected even if the file size and timestamp remain the same.</p>',fields:{title:"Samhain - File Integrity and Intrusion Detection",date:"08 Jan 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-01-08-samhain-file-integrity-and-intrusion-detection/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-01-08-samhain-file-integrity-and-intrusion-detection/",prev:{fields:{title:"Relative Success",date:"08 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-08-relative-success/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Women and IT",date:"09 Jan 2003",slug:"/2003-01-09-women-and-it/"}}}}}});
