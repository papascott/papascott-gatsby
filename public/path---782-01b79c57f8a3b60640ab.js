Sure enough, it\'s showing right now on BR. </p>\n<p>OK, the film mostly stars Cagney, as a hyperactive Coca-Cola executive in post-war pre-Wall Berlin. For example, he\'s trying to close a deal with the Russians. They offer him a Cuban cigar.</p>\n<p>"We made a deal with Castro. He sends us cigars, we send him missiles."</p>\n<p>"You\'re being cheated! This cigar is badl!"</p>\n<p>"So are the missiles."</p>\n<p>You\'ll have to see the movie yourself to know how Cagney "learns umlauts" with his German secretary.

That reminded me of the remark by <a title="Talking Points Memo: February 12th, 2003" href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0302.html#021203317am">Joshua Micah Marshall</a> a couple of weeks ago that the US routed around NATO when it came to Enduring Freedom, invoking Article V but not asking for anythng of substance. They probably thought at the time that it wasn\'t worth the bother to wait for the NATO allies. I can\'t help but think that today there would be a common trans-Atlantic position on Iraq if NATO had been on board in Afghanistan from the start two years ago.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I\'m wary of Sullivan\'s broad historical generalization of German foreign policy ("they veer from extreme romantic militarism to romantic pacifism"), since the Federal Republic has only had an foreign policy since November 1989, after going decades without. I don\'t see the connection to  ghosts of the German past.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Today's Headlines",date:"03 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-03-todays-headlines/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"One, Two, Three",date:"05 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-05-one-two-three/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Today's Headlines",date:"03 Mar 2003",slug:"/2003-03-03-todays-headlines/",tags:"Y2003"},html:"<p>Keep in mind that the three big news stories of this weekend were the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the rejection by the Turkish parliament of the deal to allow the US to attack Iraq from Turkey, and the destruction of the first Samoud missiles by Iraq.
