It was the sound<br />\nof eighteen hundred airplanes approaching Hamburg from the south at an<br />\nunimaginable height. We had already experienced two hundred or even<br />\nmore air raids, among them some very heavy ones, but this was something<br />\ncompletely new. And yet there was an immediate recognition: this was<br />\nwhat everyone had been waiting for, what had hung for months like a<br />\nshadow over everything we did, making us weary. It was the end.</em></p>\n<p>Novelist Hans Erich Nossack was forty-two when the Allied bombardments of German cities began, and he watched the destruction of Hamburg--the city where he was born and where he would later die--from across its Elbe River. He heard the whistle of the bombs and the singing of shrapnel; he watched his neighbors flee; he wondered if his home--and his manuscripts--would survive the devastation. The End is his terse, remarkable memoir of the annihilation of the city, written only three months after the bombing. A searing firsthand account of one of the most notorious events of World War II, The End is also a meditation on war and hope, history and its devastation. And it is the rare book, as W. G. Sebald noted, that describes the Allied bombing campaign from the German perspective.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The original is entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3518015230">Der Untergang</a> published by Suhrkamp.</p>\n<p><a title="North Sea Diaries - A weblog of European politics" href="http://www.north-sea.net/archives/230">(Via North Sea Diaries)</a></p>',fields:{title:"The End",date:"08 Dec 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-12-08-the-end/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-12-08-the-end/",prev:{fields:{title:"Blogroll Timestamps with Perl and Bloglines",date:"07 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-07-blogroll-timestamps-with-perl-and-bloglines/"}},next:{fields:{title:"",date:"09 Dec 2004",slug:"/2004-12-09-hamburg-blogger-gluehwein-meet/"}}}}}});
