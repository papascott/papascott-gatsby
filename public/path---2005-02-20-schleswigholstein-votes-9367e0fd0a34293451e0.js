The polls showed the SPD 3% ahead of the CDU, but the latest count shows the CDU 2% ahead. Was there really a 5% swing at the last minute, or were the polls wishful thinking from the media?</p>\n<p>Interesting that education was a major issue in the campaign, with the CDU for the traditional 3-tiered secondary school system, and the SPD for a unified system more like that in the US. Apparently the German voters are more comfortable with the old system, and I doubt that a change in school system will be a campaign issue this year or next.</p>',fields:{title:"Schleswig-Holstein Votes",date:"20 Feb 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-02-20-schleswigholstein-votes/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-02-20-schleswigholstein-votes/",prev:{fields:{title:"Dusting The Bookends",date:"19 Feb 2005",slug:"/2005-02-19-dusting-the-bookends/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Five Questions",date:"21 Feb 2005",slug:"/2005-02-21-five-questions/"}}}}}});
