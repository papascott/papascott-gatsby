As part of the process to determine whether he'll attend regular elementary school or a special ed school, he'll be evaluated for 3 days at the special ed school in Buchholz, this Friday, Monday and Tuesday. He'll be picked up by taxi the three days, and Christopher is as excited about that as he is about going to school.</p>\n<p>Already last Sunday (yes, Sunday!) we had a home visit from one of the evaluators. Her initial impression was that Christopher would be just fine at regular school, but that decision will be made by the county. </p>\n<p>For me as the stay-at-home parent this will be the first taste of the German school schedule, since Christopher will be home at 11:30 instead of the usual 3:15. There are no meals at school, unlike kindergarten where he gets breakfast and lunch. I wonder if they will give him homework as well.</p>\n<p>(Does anybody recognize the title as Grace Kelly's best line from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/\">Rear Window</a>?)</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Who Turned The Heat Off?",date:"13 Mar 2006",slug:"/2006-03-13-who-turned-the-heat-off/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Messenger Prank",date:"15 Mar 2006",slug:"/2006-03-15-messenger-prank/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Who Turned The Heat Off?",date:"13 Mar 2006",slug:"/2006-03-13-who-turned-the-heat-off/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/03//minus15.jpg" border="0" height="165" width="260" alt="minus15.jpg" /></p>\n<p>It was bad enough that we got 24 hours of snowfall on Friday, but the temperature this morning is ridiculous!

The biopsy last week revealed a cancer very similar to that he had 15 (not 10) years ago which responded very well to chemotherapy. In fact, he was much more comfortable after just one treatment. They've done the first set at the University hospital, and the remaining sets he'll be able to do closer to home.
