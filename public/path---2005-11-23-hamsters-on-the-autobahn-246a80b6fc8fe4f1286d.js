He then said he wanted to be a radio announcer, and proceeded to give a traffic report. On the Autobahn 7 traffic was being held up by hamsters on the roadway, and the police were asking motorists to avoid running over the hamsters.</p>\n<p>He then said it was just a joke, and that there weren\'t really any hamsters on the autobahn. Too bad that radio announcing seems to be a <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/003521.shtml" title="Random radio by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">dying profession</a>.
