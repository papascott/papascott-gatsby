When I started listening to <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/03/17/helden/" title="PapaScott: Helden">Wir Sind Helden</a>, I thought to myself that every line of their lyrics could be the tagline for a weblog. And now I\'ve done it. My tagline is now a random Helden lyric. The script is literally 3 lines of PHP (stolen from the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?rev=1.3&view=auto">Hello Dolly plugin </a>in WordPress), so I won\'t bother to repeat it here.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 27 Sep 2004</strong> I\'ve switched musical directions. The lyrics are now <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/26/wouldnt-it-be-nice/">Wouldn\'t It Be Nice by the Beach Boys</a>, but may return to the Helden in the future.</p>',fields:{title:"Held-O-Matic",date:"05 Jun 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-06-05-held-o-matic/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-06-05-held-o-matic/",prev:{fields:{title:"A Million Days",date:"05 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-05-a-million-days/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Party Up",date:"05 Jun 2004",slug:"/2004-06-05-party-up/"}}}}}});
