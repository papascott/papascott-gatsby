After being <a href=\"/2002/01/23/115.php\">stalled for over a year</a>, the case was tossed out on a rather significant technicality, namely that at least 30 of the party's 200 national and state leaders were paid police informants. It was thus impossible to for the court determine how much of the party's activities were instigated by informers for the government. </p>\n<p>Interior Minister Schilly and the state ministries are pinning the blame on each other. In the end, the various ministries didn't know about the other's informants. Federalism doesn't work if you don't talk to one another.
