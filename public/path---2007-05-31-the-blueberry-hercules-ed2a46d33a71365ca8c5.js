All of our coffee houses are profitable. We sell a premium product, and the guests are willing to pay the appropriate price.... There\'s a lot of room for growth here. No country drinks more coffee than Germany. We will continually expand. This year we will open more than 30 new locations.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I guess that means he\'s satisfied with a low number of premium locations, and won\'t be really competing with Tchibo or McCaf√© for market share.</p>\n<p>BTW, the title refers to the fact that the best selling product at Starbucks is not coffee, it\'s the blueberry muffin.</p>',fields:{title:"The Blueberry Hercules",date:"31 May 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-05-31-the-blueberry-hercules/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-05-31-the-blueberry-hercules/",prev:{fields:{title:"Shock and Awe",date:"31 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-31-shock-and-awe/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Fashion for the Children of Heiligendamm",date:"04 Jun 2007",slug:"/2007-06-04-fashion-for-the-children-of-heiligendamm/"}}}}}});
