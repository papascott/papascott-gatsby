It\'s about to get worse." Thousands of cases spanning decades are to be audited in Harris County, TX, a "jurisdiction (which) has produced more executions than any other county in America". This is why I don\'t like the death penalty, or Guantanamo, or the more draconian parts of the war on terror. It\'s not just that I think they\'re immoral; that, after all, can be a legitimate point of contention. I just don\'t trust the government at any level to be competent. That goes for any government, not just in the US.</p>\n<p>And not just for crime and terror.
