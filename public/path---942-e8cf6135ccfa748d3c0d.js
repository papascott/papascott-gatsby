Our router is an old Pentium 200 running <a href=\"http://www.fli4l.de\">fl14l</a>, a isdn4linux implentation that fits on a floppy. I've moved my desk and shelves to the basement, but the router has to stay upstairs since it is the peer for the wireless card in my notebook, and there is no wireless reception in the basement. But without my shelves, the router box is on a table within Christopher's reach. And he loves to pop the floppy out of the diskette drive. The router itself doesn't need the floppy disk anymore once it's running, but the DHCP server needs to write to the floppy. And Windows boxes tend to freak out if they can't find a DHCP server on startup (Linux boxes will just reuse the last settings). I just hope that Christopher doesn't try to hide the floppy once he pops it out.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"The Experiment Will Continue",date:"19 Jan 2002",slug:"/2002-01-19-the-experiment-will-continue/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Daddle",date:"21 Jan 2002",slug:"/2002-01-21-daddle/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"The Experiment Will Continue",date:"19 Jan 2002",slug:"/2002-01-19-the-experiment-will-continue/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>I started this website as an experiment, to test the bloging software Movable Type, and to see if I could keep up a second weblog.
