Prices are prominently displayed in Danish Kroner, and it\'s open <a href="http://www.scandinavian-park.com/index.php?id=33">late evenings and Sundays</a>. Among other shops there\'s a cheap <a href="http://www.etaphotel.com/etaphotel/fichehotel/gb/etp/6299/fiche_hotel.shtml">Etap hotel</a>, a <a href="http://www.heingericke-flensburg.de/">motorcycle supply shop</a>, a <a href="http://www.hier-bin-ich-koenig.de/">slot-machine arcade</a>, and a <a href="http://www.beate-uhse.com/">Beate Uhse</a> sex shop. One stop shopping at its finest.</p>\n<p>Of course if the EU ever equalized alcohol taxes the whole concept would be bankrupt in an instant.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Let's go exploring!",date:"24 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-24-lets-go-exploring/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Second Whiney Expat Bloggers in Germany Meet Up",date:"24 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-24-second-whiney-expat-bloggers-in-germany-meet-up/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Let's go exploring!",date:"24 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-24-lets-go-exploring/",tags:"Y2006"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0740748475"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/the_complete_calvin_and_hobbes.jpg" alt="the complete calvin and hobbes" align="right" border="0" /></a> Thanks to <a href="http://serendipita.org/2006/07/20/theres-treasure-everywhere/">Andrea</a>, we found that Amazon.de is offering <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0740748475">The Complete Calvin and Hobbes</a> for just EUR 63.89, less than half the list price.

At 10 kg, it\'s not light reading, but it\'s everything a Calvin and Hobbes fan could hope for (short of a rivival of the daily comic strip).</p>\n<p>Calvin and Hobbes has (for now) replaced Harry Potter as Christopher\'s bedtime reading (with on-the-fly translation by Papa). Since he\'s Calvin\'s age, I think he sees the stories not so much as humor than as absolute truth.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Sharp Objects in the Lawn",date:"21 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-21-sharp-objects-in-the-lawn/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Scandinavian Park",date:"24 Jul 2006",slug:"/2006-07-24-scandinavian-park/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:204,pageCount:1101}}}});
