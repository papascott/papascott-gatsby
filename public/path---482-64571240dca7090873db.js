With WordPress, if you want to do anything slightly different from  what it intends (for example, customizing the text of the monthly archive links, or listing the 5 latest comments), you end up writing a hack, essentially rewriting one of its PHP functions to do what you want. But PHP is at least logical and well-documented. Movable Type has it's own well-documented but esoteric template language, for which you can find plugins to make it even more esoteric, with which you can do most but not all of what you want. I have about a dozen plugins installed, but I've forgotten which ones I really use. I can do Perl, I've done Perl for 10 years, but it's simple sysadmin baby-talk Perl, not elegant Perl like Ben and Mena. So I'm stumped by something simple like 'put all my post titles inline with the post content, except when an image comes at the beginning of the post content'. There's probably a way to do that with CSS, but I can't do CSS very well either.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"They're only tools, and tools are not your friends",date:"20 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-20-theyre-only-tools-and-tools-are-not-your-friends/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Strawberry Jam Bread with Honey",date:"21 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-21-strawberry-jam-bread-with-honey/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"They're only tools, and tools are not your friends",date:"20 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-20-theyre-only-tools-and-tools-are-not-your-friends/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="But some tools are more fun than others" href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/05/20/splitting-lamp-from-the-weblog/#comments">Burningbird: They\'re only tools, and tools are not your friends</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Kindergarten Watch",date:"19 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-19-kindergarten-watch/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Plugging and Hacking",date:"21 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-21-plugging-and-hacking/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Kindergarten Watch",date:"19 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-19-kindergarten-watch/",tags:"Y2004"},html:"<p>Christopher had a busy day yesterday. Not only did he have his hearing checked (which he happily demonstrated on me last evening with his doctor kit: 'Now the big bear and the little mouse are running in your ear!'). He also checked out the speech therapy kindergarten in Winsen. He loved it. The groups are very small (9 children), they have a great gym, and best of all, a huge toy helicopter. The amount of actual therapy (twice a week) is the same as the local integration group. The director talked with him for over an hour and thought he'd he an excellent candidate for the group. She found it very good that he listens and responds to corrections.</p>\n<p>The group would also work well for his parents. The hours are 8:30 to 14:30, with transport provided (Winsen is 30 km from here). The place would be guaranteed for one year, with possible extensions after that. That's a schedule that we can plan around.</p>\n<p>The final diagnosis will be on June 17, when we have an appointment with the county health department. After that we'll be able to make some decisions for both Christopher and Papa.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Father's Day",date:"19 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-19-fathers-day/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"They're only tools, and tools are not your friends",date:"20 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-20-theyre-only-tools-and-tools-are-not-your-friends/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:482,pageCount:1101}}}});
