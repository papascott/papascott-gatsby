Oil and TÜV inspection are also due, but it\'s just not worth putting any more money into. So we\'ve been looking at a replacement, used, under 10,000.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/fotos/lupo.jpeg" alt="VM Lupo" align="right" /> We thought about a <a href="http://www.smart.com/">Smart</a>, but we sometimes need more than 2 seats. Given today\'s gas prices, we looked seriously at a diesel <a href="http://www.lupousa.com/">VW Lupo 3L TDI</a> (3L stands for 3 liters/100 km, or 78 mpg). However, they are hard to find used, and come at a pretty premium to their less efficient cousins. We expanded our search to all diesel Lupos, found an SDI nearby with a foldback sunroof (very important :-)), and signed the contract today. By Friday I\'ll be driving German after 12 years of driving French.</p>',fields:{title:"Used Car",date:"21 Aug 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-08-21-used-car/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-08-21-used-car/",prev:{fields:{title:"Olympic Schadenfreude",date:"21 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-21-olympic-coverage/"}},next:{fields:{title:"15 Minutes of Concentration",date:"22 Aug 2004",slug:"/2004-08-22-15-minutes-of-concentration/"}}}}}});
