You need to be able to add some code to your blog template, so it won't work for a lot of hosters (like BlogSpot). I was shocked to see that they priced my links at $125 each. I was even more shocked when the first two links sold almost immediately. As you can see in the sidebar under \\\"Sponsored Links\\\", I'm currently at six, so you can figure out my revenue yourself.

The links are valuable not because actual people see them, but because they get followed by search engines. My <a href=\\\"http://technorati.com/blogs/http://www.papascott.de\\\">Technorati rank</a> is about 63,000, which is impressive only if you believe there are really 55 million weblogs.
