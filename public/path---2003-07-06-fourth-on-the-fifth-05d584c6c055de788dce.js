We had twice as much food and drink as we needed, except the California red wine. And we ended up at 1am with a heated 3-way discussion of the German reaction to the Iraq war and conspiracy theories on MÃ¶llemann's death (I was listening, not discussing, on both counts). So I guess it was a successful party.</p>",fields:{title:"Fourth on the Fifth",date:"06 Jul 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-07-06-fourth-on-the-fifth/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-07-06-fourth-on-the-fifth/",prev:{fields:{title:"Morphon XML-Editor now free of charge",date:"04 Jul 2003",slug:"/2003-07-04-morphon-xml-editor-now-free-of-charge/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Comment Guidelines",date:"08 Jul 2003",slug:"/2003-07-08-comment-guidelines/"}}}}}});
