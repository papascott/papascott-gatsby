Even though there are ever more commericial stations in Europe with more time to fill, it is cheaper for them to produce their own shows than to buy from the US. At least in Germany, there are no US series in prime time any more (although plenty of American movies)... a show like \'Friends\' might be on after 11 pm or on Saturday afternoon. And to add insult to injury, even American television is becoming less American. Three of the top ten shows (Big Brother, Survivor, Millionaire) are imported concepts.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Sandbox Season",date:"02 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-02-sandbox-season/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Pop Culture Spreads Thin",date:"05 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-05-pop-culture-spreads-thin/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Sandbox Season",date:"02 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-02-sandbox-season/",tags:"Y2001"},html:'<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/sand.jpg" height="200" width="250" border="0" alt="sand.jpg: " /></p>\n<p>The sandbox season is now officially open. After some initial hesitation (what is this strange stuff on my toes?!?), Christopher spent nearly two hours on his first visit to his sandbox.

He\'s put up a wall and gate between the patio and house as \'Christopher protection\' (as much to protect the outside world from Christopher as vice versa), and we\'re now looking at the drainage from the patio itself. Well, right now it doesn\'t drain so much as seep, very slowly. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/summit.jpg" height="324" width="250" border="0" alt="summit.jpg: " /></p>\n<p>Yesterday was the annual grandparent summit in Eckernf√∂rde, a family event second to only Christmas on our calendar.
