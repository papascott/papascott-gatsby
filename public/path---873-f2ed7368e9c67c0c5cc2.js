The ex-communist PDS (6%) holds the balance of power. The PDS would tolerate a Red-Green government, but it remains to be seen whether Schröder would tolerate being tolerated. The trend for the Union/FDP is falling, as this is their lowest rating in 8 months. </p>\n<p>On a personal level on who Germans would prefer as Chancellor, Schröder leads Stoiber by a wide margin (49% to 36% in the last poll I saw). Not that it matters... German election ballots list parties and not Chancellor candidates.</p>\n<p>My feeling is that Schröder is slicker than Slick Willy when it comes to campaigning, and that Stoiber, used to safe majorities in Bavaria, is a babe in the woods when it comes to a real election and has no idea what's going to hit him. But I'm rooting for Stoiber to lose, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Blogchalk",date:"10 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-10-blogchalk/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"faz in english now weekly",date:"11 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-11-faz-in-english-now-weekly/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Blogchalk",date:"10 Jul 2002",slug:"/2002-07-10-blogchalk/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Why not?
