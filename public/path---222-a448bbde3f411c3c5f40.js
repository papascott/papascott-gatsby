I need to find a new secret name for my wife. "Mama" doesn\'t seem to cut it... it certainly describes Christopher\'s relationship to her, but not mine. "Voldemort" (she who must not be named) is too sinister. "Maus", her real nickname, is too cute (and is already <a href="That Queer Expatriate: Caterpillar Footwear">taken</a>). She often uses a variation of "Maus" that refers to her employer, but mentioning her employer here is taboo. <a href="http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/">Claire</a> calls her spouse "The German".
