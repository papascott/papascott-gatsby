No family or friends of ours would be normally commuting on that highway during evening rush hour.</p>\n<p>However I know the bridge and the neighborhood well. It crosses the Mississippi between downtown Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota, and I lived near the bridge in Southeast Minneapolis my first two years in college. <a href="http://davespicks.com/">Blogger DaveP</a> lives in that neighborhood today.</p>\n<p>Minneapolis like Hamburg is a city built on a river. You cross bridges over the river every day without giving it a second thought, taking it for granted. Thank God that due to road maintenance, only one lane was open on the bridge in each direction. It could have been a lot worse.</p>',fields:{title:"Bridge Collapse",date:"02 Aug 2007",url:"https://papascott.de/2007-08-02-bridge-collapse/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2007-08-02-bridge-collapse/",prev:{fields:{title:"24 Hr Live Bait",date:"30 Jul 2007",slug:"/2007-07-30-24-hr-live-bait/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Coming Home",date:"07 Aug 2007",slug:"/2007-08-07-coming-home-2/"}}}}}});
