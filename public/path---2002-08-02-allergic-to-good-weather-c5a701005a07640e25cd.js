The lung test was negative, but he still sent me home with a <a href=\"http://www.pari.de/english/300/310/314/\">PariBoy inhalator</a> and a box of Emser Salt solution. I'm skeptical. I'm home from work and feeling better today, but I think it's because the rain started again last night.</p>",fields:{title:"Allergic To Good Weather",date:"02 Aug 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-08-02-allergic-to-good-weather/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-08-02-allergic-to-good-weather/",prev:{fields:{title:"15 Games Ahead",date:"02 Aug 2002",slug:"/2002-08-02-15-games-ahead/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Heroes of Flight 93",date:"02 Aug 2002",slug:"/2002-08-02-heroes-of-flight-93/"}}}}}});
