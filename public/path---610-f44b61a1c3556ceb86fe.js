No matter which system I would chose, there would be some overhead in learning and in rearranging my work. </p>\n<p>Finally, inspired last week the implementation of templates at <a href="http://www.blogg.de">blogg.de</a>, I jumped into the <a title="Smarty : Template Engine" href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a> template engine. And as I implemented my first template, I promptly made my first newbie mistake, namely confusing \'caching\' with \'pre-compiling\'. I set my language-specific entry page to be cached, and wondered why my site was suddenly only in German. After a slight bout of panic, I checked the docs and found I could set <a href="http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/caching.multiple.caches.php">separate caches</a> for German and English. </p>\n<p>I knew this would be as much fun as having my teeth cleaned. But unlike going to the dentist, hopefully I only have to learn Smarty once, and can then use it for all my little PHP projects.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Klingon is not in Unicode",date:"14 Oct 2003",slug:"/2003-10-14-klingon-is-not-in-unicode/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Spiegel Online: Whale found in Hamburg Harbor",date:"14 Oct 2003",slug:"/2003-10-14-spiegel-online-whale-found-in-hamburg-harbor/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:610,pageCount:1101}}}});
