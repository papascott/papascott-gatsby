Kidnap Americans, take over their embassies, kill and maim them, burn their homes and businesses. Now that standard has been lowered. According to this <a title=\"Davids Medienkritik: German Contradictions / Deutsche WiderspÃ¼che\" href=\"http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/this_is_an_exce.html\">thread at Medienkritik</a> (a blog dedicated to anti-Americanism), these days it's enough to read Michael Moore and oppose the Iraq war. Sorry, for me expressing opinion is as American as it gets, and merely expressing opinions against a particular administration, especially when the same opinions are held by a good number of Americans, does <em>not</em> qualify one as anti-American. No, to become anti-American you need to threaten me for who I am, for the color of my passport. Mere disagreement does not qualify.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the thread brings a number of offensive anti-German prejudices to light. Germans are Nazis. Germans are greedy. Germans never forgive. Germans are undemocratic. Replace all the 'Germans' with 'Jews', and you'd have a number of quotes worthy of Martin Hohmann.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"How to upgrade Mandrake easily with only one reboot",date:"03 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-03-how-to-upgrade-mandrake-easily-with-only-one-reboot/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Germany's Best Employers",date:"04 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-04-germanys-best-employers/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"How to upgrade Mandrake easily with only one reboot",date:"03 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-03-how-to-upgrade-mandrake-easily-with-only-one-reboot/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p><a title="I\'ve used this a dozen times this month, might as well link it" href="http://www.pclinuxonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7018">How to upgrade Mandrake easily with only one reboot</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"More States",date:"02 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-02-more-states/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Anti-Americanism in Germany",date:"04 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-04-anti-americanism-in-germany/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:537,pageCount:1101}}}});
