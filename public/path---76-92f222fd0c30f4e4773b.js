(Today <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/manitowoc-rejoins-battle-enodis-211/story.aspx?guid={1145C807-9C4A-4583-AD43-3BFFC1B54524}">Manitowok increased it\'s offer to $2.1 billion</a>). All three are big suppliers to McDonald\'s,</p>\n<p>In our kitchen, the biggest pieces of equipment are <a href="http://www.garland-group.com/">Garland</a> grills and <a href="http://www.frymaster.com/">Frymaster</a> fryers. Both come from divisions of Enodis. In fact, we\'re looking at investing in a <a href="http://www.frymaster.com/?xhtml=xhtml/fry/us/en/general/protector.html&amp;xsl=root.xsl">new energy-efficient low-oil-volume fryer</a> from Frymaster this year (right now the low dollar makes the price attractive). Our beverage system, on the other hand, comes from the <a href="http://www.manitowocbeverage.com/">Multiplex</a> division of Manitowok.</p>\n<p>The result of the bidding war will not of course affect our investment decision. And we don\'t know whether the consolidation will result in more efficiency with lower prices or higher prices due to reduced competition. We just need to increase our fryer capacity.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Signs on the Autobahn",date:"17 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-17-signs-on-the-autobahn/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"An Honor Killing in Hamburg",date:"23 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-23-an-honor-killing-in-hamburg/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Signs on the Autobahn",date:"17 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-17-signs-on-the-autobahn/",tags:"Y2008"},html:'<p>This week we installed signs on the Autobahn A1 a couple of km on either side of the Dibbersen exit. So whether you are coming from Bremen or from Hamburg and you didn\'t know about our McDonald\'s in Dibbersen, you will now.</p>\n<p>German restrictions on such signs are very strict, so compared to what you see on American interstates, the signs are small, low to the ground, and set quite far from the highway. They also are not cheap; we need a dozen additional guests each day for the signs to be worth the cost. If the past couple of days are any indication, the signs seem to be working, although business could also be up as a result of the cooler weather and the Euro promotion that just started (mmmm, mini-schnitzels).</p>\n<p>It\'s very difficult to take a picture of a small sign from a moving car, so for now I have to settle for showing the digital proof.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/a1signage.jpg" alt="A1 Signage for Dibbersen" border="0" width="450" height="338" /></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Coming Soon to a Carport Near Us",date:"15 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-15-coming-soon-to-a-carport-near-us/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Takeover Battle for Enodis",date:"19 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-19-takeover-battle-for-enodis/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Coming Soon to a Carport Near Us",date:"15 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-15-coming-soon-to-a-carport-near-us/",tags:"Y2008"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2494663604" title="View \'RedBomber\' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/2494663604_ba144702f7.jpg" alt="RedBomber" border="0" width="500" height="206" /></a></p>\n<p>Frauke\'s always wanted a red car: <a href="http://www.volkswagen.de/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/de3/modelle/Tiguan/ausstattungslinien/track___field.html">Volkswagen Tiguan 2.0 TDI 125 kW Track &amp; Field</a>.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Frauke and the iPhone",date:"06 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-06-frauke-and-the-iphone/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Signs on the Autobahn",date:"17 May 2008",slug:"/2008-05-17-signs-on-the-autobahn/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:76,pageCount:1101}}}});
