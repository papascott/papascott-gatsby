But since we\'ve never been to Paris, it would be somehow unfair to go to Paris without my wife, wouldn\'t it? (Although the first vision I have of going to Paris with my wife is losing her like in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0095174">Frantic</a>... would I go jumping on roofs like Harrison Ford to look for her?

I\'ve heard of meth labs near my old home town in Minnesota, but meth is a rural phenomenon that began after I left, so the disruption and destruction that meth addiction can cause in small towns was new to me, especially when the economy is failing. In this particular story a local businessman is taking advantage of young women who need money for the drug. After a woman is killed in a car accident, her mother had the courage to gather evidence and go to the police. <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/04/methamphetamine_wreckage_in_montana.php" title="Mark A.
