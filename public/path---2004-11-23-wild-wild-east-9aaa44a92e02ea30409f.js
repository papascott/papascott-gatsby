(The LiveJournal link is his personal blog, professionally he has several Russian news sites including <a href="http://www.mosnews.com/" title="MOSNEWS.COM">mosnews.com</a> in English.) It was interesting to hear his main first impression of Germany: the "friendly" roads and drivers. The autobahns are certainly well built, and built for speed, but are German drivers really friendly? But then I remembered the t.A.T.u. album title "200 km/h in the Wrong Lane"... if that\'s a description of Russian driving, then German drivers must seem very friendly indeed. </p>\n<p>When I told him I came from Minnesota, he immediately thought of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/">Fargo</a>, and asked if Minnesotans really use wood chippers that way (if you\'ve never seen the movie, don\'t ask...). He also got the impression that Minnesota is colder than Moscow. Somehow I doubt that.</p>\n<p>Finally, he refuted one of my misconceptions about journalists. I had just maintained on the train ride to Cologne to Heiko and Gerd that the difference between journalists and bloggers is that blogger are can choose *not* to write, that they do not have a quota of minutes or column inches to fill. But Anton told me of a certain business dispute in Russia where both sides were paying him *not* to report the details, a form of reverse PR. He had no problems with that, since he wasn\'t intending to report on it anyway, but he was still disappointed when the dispute was settled.</p>',fields:{title:"Wild Wild East",date:"23 Nov 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-11-23-wild-wild-east/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-11-23-wild-wild-east/",prev:{fields:{title:"Pirates of the Internet",date:"23 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-23-pirates-of-the-internet/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Leappad Comes To Germany",date:"24 Nov 2004",slug:"/2004-11-24-leappad-comes-to-germany/"}}}}}});
