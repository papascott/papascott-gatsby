In the German health care system, doctors seem to get the short end of the financial stick.

And the typical Geman is very good at complaining about irregularities.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Night Out",date:"05 Aug 2002",slug:"/2002-08-05-night-out/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"The German Way?",date:"07 Aug 2002",slug:"/2002-08-07-the-german-way/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Night Out",date:"05 Aug 2002",slug:"/2002-08-05-night-out/",tags:"Y2002"},html:"<p>Saturday night was Christopher's first night with a real babysitter.
