A bit overpriced, I would say. If I were to introduce weblogs into my company\'s intranet (100 employees), it would be cheaper to install a Notes server (<em>with</em> hardware and much more functionality) than to license MT.</p>\n<p>The controversy, though, reminds me of when Userland Frontier went commercial in the late \'90s. A great product, an active developer community... but when it was no longer free, the community disintegrated. I hope that Six Apart is paying attention, and will rethink its pricing.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Last One Gone is a Rotten Egg!",date:"14 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-14-last-one-gone-is-a-rotten-egg/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"What WordPress Does Right",date:"14 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-14-what-wordpress-does-right/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Last One Gone is a Rotten Egg!",date:"14 May 2004",slug:"/2004-05-14-last-one-gone-is-a-rotten-egg/",tags:"Y2004"},html:'<p>Press release from my employer: "The company is carrying on discussions with potential investors to secure continued financing.
