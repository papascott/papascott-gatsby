It\'s roomy inside, and has a lot of surface area for company logos. We can also take advantage of the fleet rebate by ordering through McDonald\'s. We just had to wait until the firm was officially formed before placing the order.</p>\n<p>We got the paperwork for the GmbH back today, and MamaMaus called the fleet coordinator to say that the order could now be placed. "Great," she said, "I\'ll just need you to send back a paper copy with your signature and company stamp, then we can send in the order."</p>\n<p>Company rubber stamp? We just ordered it today as well, delivery takes 14 days. Noone told us we\'d need a stamp immediately. Looks like we\'ll pick up an instant stamp from Staples and somehow add a logo to it. The Touran is going to take 9 weeks as it is.</p>\n<p>On a related note, MamaMaus ordered business cards for herself, but not for me because we don\'t know what title I should have.

It\'s not quite as obtuse as "handy", which in English isn\'t even a noun, but is a bit confusing nonetheless. A German "<a href="http://dict.leo.org/ende?lang=en&amp;lp=ende&amp;search=homepage">Homepage</a>" refers to an entire website, and not just the start page as one might think.</p>\n<p>Whatever... our business now has a homepage in both senses of the word, since right now it\'s only a single dummy page. But it\'s never too early to start building up Google juice. Check it out at <a href="http://mcdonalds-nordheide.de/">http://mcdonalds-nordheide.de/</a>.</p>\n<p>We\'ve decided to start small with the site design. You might recognize it as the <a href="http://getk2.com/">K2 template</a> for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. We\'ve looked at a lot of local McDonald\'s sites (<a href="http://www.mcdonalds-regensburg.de/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mcdonalds-hannover.de/">here</a> are two examples). We considered using a professional design (especially considering that I\'m "<a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/07/09/30-ways-to-leave-your-lover/">chromatically challenged</a>"). However I do have a business partner with a good sense of taste and style and the communication skills to get those across, even to me. At this stage, it\'s more important for the site to be clear and current than to have a "flashy" design.</p>\n<p>Using WordPress as a CMS also fits in our "less is more" strategy for non-essential expenses, particularly for IT. WordPress has enough features for a small site (particularly "<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages">pages</a>" and being able to set a "front page"). Should we outgrow it, we can always scale up later (as opposed to investing time and money now on something too big for our needs).</p>\n<p>Now we need to start working on content...</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Hamburg's Coffee Mile",date:"19 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-19-hamburgs-coffee-mile/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"For Want of a Nail",date:"22 May 2007",slug:"/2007-05-22-for-want-of-a-nail/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:127,pageCount:1101}}}});
