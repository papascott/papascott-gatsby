She then gave two examples of blogs that go beyond that, that attempt to bring together two sides of long-running conflicts for constructive dialog: <a title="Slugger O\'Toole" href="http://www.sluggerotoole.com/">Slugger O\'Toole</a> (Northern Ireland) and <a title="DialogNow || Open forum for discussing India-Pakistan relations" href="http://www.dialognow.org/">DialogNow</a> (India/Pakistan). </p>\n<p>I\'ve always tried to put a wide range of opinions in my blogroll (which is not just for show, it\'s what I actually read), but I\'ve never taken it beyond that. What are the prerequsites for establishing such a dialog? A passion for the issue and resolving the conflict, of course, what what else? Cross-cultural experience? Being bilingual (when language plays a role)? Or is it just being able to see beyond the box?</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Drugstore of Hope",date:"24 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-24-drugstore-of-hope/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Don't blog me, I'm real!",date:"25 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-25-dont-blog-me-im-real/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Drugstore of Hope",date:"24 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-24-drugstore-of-hope/",tags:"Y2003"},html:'<p><img alt="apotheke.jpg" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/apotheke.jpg" width="150" height="113" border="0" /></p>\n<p>Pictures from Vienna by Nico at <a title="Noch\'n Blogg.: Wien Bilder" href="http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000237.html#000237">Noch\'n Blogg.</a></p>'},next:{fields:{title:"[BlogTalk] Updated List of Conference Bloggers",date:"24 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-24-blogtalk-updated-list-of-conference-bloggers/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Waging Peace",date:"24 May 2003",slug:"/2003-05-24-waging-peace/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:725,pageCount:1101}}}});
