It has been over 3 months since my last blog post.</p>\n<p>And about the time of that last blog post I noticed that my weight and fitness were both leaving much to be desired. (I\'m sure my wife noticed long before I did, and I\'m sure she tried to let me know about it, and I\'m even more sure I did my best to ignore her.) My weight was brushing up to triple-figures in kilograms (that\'s 220 pounds in dog years), and that was my wake-up call.</p>\n<p>For the past couple of months I\'ve been trying to put myself first as far as diet and exercise go. Instead of just thinking about going to the gym, I actually went to the gym three times a week. As motivation I bought a Spotify subscription for my cell phone and a set of <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/backbeat-go">Plantronics BackBeat Go</a> wireless sport headphones (as <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013489.html">recommended by vowe</a>â€¦ with gadgets you can do much worse than to buy <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013739.html">what vowe keeps</a>).</p>\n<p>I also retook the <a href="http://www.myline24.de/">MyLine</a> nutrition course at our gym. Having taken it once before, it all sounded familiar and I was able to take more of it to heart than the first time. The first change they recommend is to eat 5 times a day. That\'s not as easy as it sounds. Avoiding alcohol is also a challenge. :-)</p>\n<p>But between the workouts and the nutrition and the positive motivation I was able to see results after two months. 6 kilos lost. Body fat reduced by nearly 3 percentage points. Waist and hips 3 cm smaller. Not bad for a guy who just turned 51.</p>\n<p>If you\'re doing the math, you\'ll know my weight is not yet ideal. (To help you calculate BMI, my height is 174 cm. As my trainer said, if I were 15 cm taller my weight would be ideal.) So\'ll I\'ll be sticking with the program for another 3 months.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, my next goal has been handed to me on a silver platter. Our business co-sponsors the local "<a href="http://www.buchholzerstadtlauf.de/">Stadtlauf</a>" (city run) in June, and the organizer told (not asked) my wife, "and your husband will run 5K this time". I\'ll take that as a challenge.</p>',fields:{title:"Back to the Grind",date:"02 Apr 2013",url:"https://papascott.de/2013-04-02-back-to-the-grind/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2013-04-02-back-to-the-grind/",prev:{fields:{title:"More Blessed to Give",date:"29 Dec 2012",slug:"/2012-12-29-more-blessed-to-give/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Salt of the Earth",date:"04 Apr 2013",slug:"/2013-04-04-salt-of-the-earth/"}}}}}});
