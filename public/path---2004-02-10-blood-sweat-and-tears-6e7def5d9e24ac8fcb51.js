We haven\'t had a "wartime president" since FDR, and there\'s a good reason for that: you\'re only a wartime president if you act like you\'re at war. That means placing the country on a wartime footing, putting aside petty politics to forge a bipartisan wartime consensus, and telling the nation in no uncertain terms that sacrifices need to be made. George Bush has done none of those things."</p>',fields:{title:"Blood, Sweat and Tears",date:"10 Feb 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-02-10-blood-sweat-and-tears/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-02-10-blood-sweat-and-tears/",prev:{fields:{title:"Forty-two",date:"09 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-09-forty-two/"}},next:{fields:{title:"PapaScott Sells Out",date:"10 Feb 2004",slug:"/2004-02-10-papascott-sells-out/"}}}}}});
