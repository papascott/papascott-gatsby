He\'s apparently very dry and businesslike. When asked the difference between working in the US and in Germany, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In Germany I am called Dr. Bernhard, in the US I was called Wolfgang. Otherwise the problems are just the same.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>An attempt to make the interview more personal failed.
