However, we have no idea where to find crab in Germany. No restaurant we know of serves it. Last night he had to settle for shrimp cocktail and shrimp soup from our local Greek restaurant. However, he did take the time to tell us with pencil and paper what he really wanted.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3355343349" title="View \'shopping list\' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3417/3355343349_a6fa3a7dfe.jpg" alt="shopping list" border="0" width="500" height="352" /></a></p>\n<p>However, we knew the Metro cash-and-carry store has a huge seafood department, and we promised him we would look there today.

Looking on the internet, I found recommendations to let it thaw overnight, but that surely wouldn\'t do for the impatient Christopher.
