Are the baby blues setting in already? Or are we as new parents just unsure of ourselves? Is nursing really supposed to be such a struggle? </p>\n<p>It took me a couple of days before I was ready to write a story about <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$50">Birthing Christopher</a>. Participating in the birth as a father is very psychologically draining. </p>\n<p>There\'s a new round of Christopher pictures at <a href="http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=864301102&n=3490345">Ofoto</a> (registration required). I\'m still learning how to use the digital camera. I don\'t feel comfortable using flash in the hospital, but in low light without flash, some pictures are very blurry.</p>\n<p>This evening we learned that Christopher has a high bilirubin count, meaning he has newborn jaundice. It\'s not a serious condition, and not uncommon (especially for vacuum extracted babies), but means he needs to spend at least a day separated from us in an incubator under ultraviolet lights.</p>\n<p>This also means Mama\'s hospital stay will be prolonged by a couple of days, so we\'ll be ringing in the new millenium together in her room at AK Harburg. I\'ll smuggle in a bottle of champagne for the two of us.</p>',fields:{title:"Christopher Ryan Hanson",date:"30 Dec 1999",url:"https://papascott.de/1999-12-30-christopher-ryan-hanson/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/1999-12-30-christopher-ryan-hanson/",prev:{fields:{title:"Birthing Christopher",date:"30 Dec 1999",slug:"/1999-12-30-birthing-christopher/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Christopher Ryan Hanson",date:"31 Dec 1999",slug:"/1999-12-31-christopher-ryan-hanson/"}}}}}});
