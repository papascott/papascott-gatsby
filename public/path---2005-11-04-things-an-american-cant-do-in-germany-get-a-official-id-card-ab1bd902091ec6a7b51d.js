Yes, it\'s evil, but probably less evil than (like in the States) having your credit information available for anyone to buy. And there once you\'ve opened a checking account, obtained a telephone, applied for a driver\'s license, registered to vote and filed a tax return, anyone who wants to is going to have your address anyway...</p>\n<p>But I digress. Everyone here has to register their current address. But only German citizens get a plastic card that documents that, namely a <em>Personalausweis</em> or ID card. It\'s pretty handy, in fact you can travel throughout most of Europe with it instead of a passport, and it is accepted as identification for just about anything for which you need to identify yourself, and it\'s pretty much assumed that everyone has one. That favorite American ID card, the driver\'s license, won\'t work here since German DLs never expire and don\'t include an address. Strangely enough, the auto registration does include a current address, but no picture.</p>\n<p>But foreigners can\'t get a <em>Personalausweis</em>. You need to rely on your passport and the paper receipt from the <em>Einwohnermeldeamt</em>. <a href="http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2005/10/and-i-didnt-even-whine-that-much.html" title="Mausi: and I didn\'t even whine that much!">Technically</a> you are required to carry identification with you at all times. In 15 years, though, I\'ve never been asked by the police for identification. Actually, I hardly ever carry my passport with me since I\'m afraid I\'d <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/30/lost-passport/" title="PapaScott » Blog Archive » Lost Passport">lose</a> it. I do have a photocopy of the important pages in my billfold, and I\'ve been told that that will suffice.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I\'ve been asked to show my passport and registration when I least expect it, when performing suspicious and sensitive activities such as changing telephone providers, renewing my cell phone, or renting a video. Then it\'s a pain not to have a <em>Personalausweis</em>.</p>',fields:{title:"Things An American Can't Do In Germany: Get a Official ID Card",date:"04 Nov 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-11-04-things-an-american-cant-do-in-germany-get-a-official-id-card/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-11-04-things-an-american-cant-do-in-germany-get-a-official-id-card/",prev:{fields:{title:"PapaScott on Rails",date:"04 Nov 2005",slug:"/2005-11-04-papascott-on-rails/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Moon Mission",date:"08 Nov 2005",slug:"/2005-11-08-moon-mission/"}}}}}});
