I\'ve asked that blogrolling.com support an OPML version of the rolls it creates." So I\'ll add the blogroll &lt;link&gt; and see if anyone complains.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"What goes around comes around",date:"02 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-02-what-goes-around-comes-around/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Christopher Update, Without Pictures",date:"04 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-04-christopher-update-without-pictures/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"What goes around comes around",date:"02 Jun 2002",slug:"/2002-06-02-what-goes-around-comes-around/",tags:"Y2002"},html:'<p>Last Sunday I put in the <a href="/2002/05/27/index.php#001739">blogroll</a> script, which I adapted from a <a href="http://philringnalda.com/phpblogroll/">script</a> by Phil Ringnalda.
