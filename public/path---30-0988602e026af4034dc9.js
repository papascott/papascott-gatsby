It\'s been over five weeks since my last post</p>\n<p>Our summer "vacation" was a busy as we suspected it would be. The restaurant in Rade, the truck stop store without a truck stop, is as busy as we hoped it would be. The self-serve "Easy Order" kiosks are in but are not being frequented that much yet (around 3% of guests). I suspect most people walk by not knowing what they are. Our first store in Dibbersen has been holding its own, down just a bit from last year despite having the brand new store just a few km away. </p>\n<p>However it was our store in Harburg that gave us the nicest surprise. A couple of weeks ago we found our neighboring Burger King had subtly changed.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/non-bk.jpg" alt="Non bk" border="0" width="500" height="373" style="float:right;" /></p>\n<p>It had become a non-Burger King. Apparently BK had cancelled their franchise. The restaurant is still open as a generic burger joint, but it doesn\'t look open and we\'re getting a surprise plus. Now we just need to get staffed to match.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile we had sent our son to my parents in Minnesota for 3 weeks, after the success of his Easter voyage. He arrived just at the peak of the heat wave (110°F), but it was cooler at the lake and he pretty much caught all the sunfish he could get (final count over 60). I flew over for the last few days of his visit to catch up with my folks and bring him home. It was nice to get a couple of days of sanity time. </p>\n<p>Today school starts, our son is in the 6th grade, and our schedule gets back to "normal", whatever normal turns out to be this fall.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Open",date:"11 Jul 2011",slug:"/2011-07-11-open/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Driving the E-Smart",date:"01 Sep 2011",slug:"/2011-09-01-driving-the-e-smart/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Open",date:"11 Jul 2011",slug:"/2011-07-11-open/",tags:"Y2011"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925439308" title="View \'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5925439308_3b1550f09c_m.jpg\' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:right;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5925439308_3b1550f09c_m.jpg" width="180" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5925439308_dc47742365_m.jpg" height="240" /></a>We\'ve been open in Rade for over a week, and the good news is that sales are pretty much what we expected and that most stuff works. However it\'s been a hectic two weeks, full of major and minor disasters. </p>\n<p>Construction chaos: Standard construction time is 12 weeks, and 10 weeks would be extremely fast. We were built in 9 weeks, and actually less than that considering the holidays in May and June. Coordination among sub-contractors is always difficult, and was complicated by the accelerated schedule. Everyone seemed to be constantly waiting on somebody else.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925270734" title="View \'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg\' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:left;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg" width="240" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg" height="180" /></a>Telecommunications: The biggest disaster, and still not solved. The line was applied for in April, but it took over 8 weeks for our telephone and DSL providers (one is magenta, the other is red) to figure out 1) exactly where our site was located, 2) that we\'d have a different area code than our postal address, and 3) DSL would not be available at the site until May 2012. It\'s perhaps a sad fact of modern times, but we can\'t sell hamburgers without a working data connection... specifically, to program and maintain our POS system. The situation is complicated by the fact that magenta and red don\'t talk directly to one another and always blame each other for whatever problems occur. The current status is that we\'ll get super-slow 300 Kbit DSL this week, in the meantime they cobbled a connection first with UMTS (3G cellular) and then over the landline.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925448352" title="View \'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg\' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:right;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg" width="" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg" height="" /></a>POS System: As a result of the telecom woes, we didn\'t have a base POS system in place until 10 hours before opening with no time to test. The shaky data connection meant our help desk couldn\'t log in to us to fix the inevitable problems. The system crashed hard on close the first two nights. Our McCafé registers weren\'t properly connected to the system, and our Day 1 sales data for McCafé are gone. The operating system for the POS is brand new and pretty much undocumented. Our knowledge of the previous system is useless for the new system, so we were dependent on the help desk for setting things up for our requirements. Good thing for us the Easy Order kiosks did not arrive in time, that would have been just an added complication. Things pretty much work now, and we expect the kiosks by the end of the month.</p>\n<p>Freezer: On Wednesday evening, Day 6 after opening, the refrigeration technician finished the final adjustments to our walk-in freezer and declared the installation for complete. The next morning the temperature inside was +5°C. Our entire frozen stock worth over 14000 had to be destroyed. Our logistics partner brought us a freezer truck to store our new stock so we could get back in business right away. The original installers were never able to get the freezer up and running. On Saturday a new firm was brought in, and the found and fixed the problem within minutes. The installer had literally gotten the wires crossed. The freezer has been at a stable -22°C for 48 hours, and we\'ll move our stock back inside today. Legally, the unit is under guarantee, and our costs will be covered by the general contractor.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925452164" title="View \'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5925452164_04c5094973_m.jpg\' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:right;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5925452164_04c5094973_m.jpg" width="240" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5925452164_d61e983360_m.jpg" height="180" /></a>All in all, the disasters were all things outside our responsibility and control.
