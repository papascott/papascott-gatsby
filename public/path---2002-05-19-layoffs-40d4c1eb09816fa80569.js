My dept was also hit; my office mate, a Sr Systems Manager who has been with the company since it was founded, was among those let go.</p>\n<p>This came totally out of the blue. This week we had announced a new customer and 1st quarter numbers (a slight loss). I don't know whether this is the beginning of the death spiral for the company, or if management just decided to get rid of some people they don't like. Neither possibility is pleasant to think about, and Tuesday (Monday is a holiday) will be an interesting work day, I'm sure.</p>",fields:{title:"Layoffs",date:"19 May 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-05-19-layoffs/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-05-19-layoffs/",prev:{fields:{title:"Would It Have Made A Difference?",date:"17 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-17-would-it-have-made-a-difference/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Fahrrad!",date:"20 May 2002",slug:"/2002-05-20-fahrrad/"}}}}}});
