The physical card was the problem. The INS\nmanaged to misspell her name on the card three times before finally\ngetting it right, several months later.</p>\n<p>Easy come, easy go. A couple of weeks after <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/09/as-the-wall-fell/">we moved to Germany in\n1990</a>, we\ntook a day trip to Berlin to see what all the fuss was about. We got\ncompletely lost in the Friedrichstraße S-Bahn station (where the\npassport control for Westerners used to be, the maze of hallways were\nstill there but absolutely no signs), and once we got out, her purse was\nstolen. Passport, ID, and green card, all gone.</p>\n<p>We reported everything stolen, but we never had the green card replaced,\nsince she was no longer a resident of the US, much less a permanent\nresident. We figured that was a detail we could take care of when we\nmoved back the the States. As it turned out, that hasn\'t happened yet.\n<em>Cest la vie</em></p>',fields:{title:"Green Card",date:"30 Mar 2011",url:"https://papascott.de/2011-03-30-green-card/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2011-03-30-green-card/",prev:{fields:{title:"And the winner is...
