In English we did away with the informal forms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou">"thee" and "thou"</a> ages ago, but in German one still has to sort out the formal "Sie" and the informal "Du".</p>\n<p>When we took over the restaurant we made the conscious decision to address all employees as "Du" and by first name and invite them to address us the same way. For one thing, we wanted to send a signal that we were going to be very involved in the restaurant and be very accessible to all employees. The staff were pretty much all "duzing" one another anyway, and we wanted to be included. Our own experience with "Du" at the workplace had been good... Frauke had always been on a first-name basis with her top-level subordinates, and I had been in the IT industry where "Du" is the norm. In addition, we didn\'t to play any favorites. In any workplace you start "duzing" a few employees, and you end up the appearance that some employees are more favored than others. Finally, we wanted to remove a barrier to communication... it\'s a lot shorter and quicker to say "Frauke" than "Frau Petersen-Hanson".</p>\n<p>I know from experience the switch can be somewhat unnerving. After working in a traditional German office environment (well, as traditional as working mostly with expats can be), I was floored to be addressed as Du by the CEO on my first day working at an IT firm. The novelty and cuteness wears off after a few days, though, and it becomes normal.</p>\n<p>Our results in the restaurant have been mostly positive. The new hires pick up on it right away, and the old hands after a time have gotten used to our first names, though some still use the Sie pronoun. That\'s OK... we\'re not playing IKEA and forcing everyone to say Du to one another. Interestingly, it\'s the foreign-born staff that has put up the most resistance. I guess after having learned Du and Sie in a new language, it\'s hard to shift gears. Or maybe we haven\'t communicated our reasons well enough.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"PapaScott On Tour (Not)",date:"18 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-18-papascott-on-tour-not/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"Grand Opening In The New Style",date:"27 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-27-grand-opening-in-the-new-style/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"PapaScott On Tour (Not)",date:"18 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-18-papascott-on-tour-not/",tags:"Y2007"},html:"<p>I had really hoped to make it to the <a href=\"http://www.jbittner.com/germany/2007/08/3rd-whiney-expat-blogger-in-germany.html\">Whiney Expat Blogger in Germany Meet-Up</a> in Dresden this weekend. I cleared my own schedule and have the weekend off, but alas my time depends on two other schedules as well. I couldn't leave Christopher alone with Frauke on the weekend our construction starts getting serious, so we agreed that I would stay at home.</p>\n<p>Too bad. I haven't been to Dresden since 1995, and I'm sure a lot has changed since then. And now that they've build the A14 Autobahn between Magdeburg and Dresden, it's a lot easier to get to. Google Maps says it's a 4:20 drive, and Google forgets that Germany has no speed limit.</p>\n<p>In any case, I've tried to do some extra whining on PapaScott the past few weeks to make up for my absence. And once our McCaf&eacute; is up and running, maybe we can host a mini-meetup and invite some bloggers over for coffee and cake (sometime in the first half of 2008).</p>\n<p>In the meantime I've registered for the <a href=\"http://www.wordcamp08.de/\">German WordCamp conference in Hamburg</a> on January 27-28. One of my <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/GermanPermalinks\">plugins</a> in the German WordPress distribution, so I might still have some street cred regarding WordPress. My free time is tentative, so I might have to cancel at the last minute, but by then our business should have settled down somewhat.</p>"},next:{fields:{title:"Customer Order Display",date:"17 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-17-customer-order-display/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"You Can Say You To Me",date:"20 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-20-you-can-say-you-to-me/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Customer Order Display",date:"17 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-17-customer-order-display/",tags:"Y2007"},html:'<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2037810086" title="View \'CIMG0343\' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2205/2037810086_eacbbb935c.jpg" alt="CIMG0343" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>Yesterday as part of our remodelling we installed a new drive-thru order taking system. It features a Customer Order Display, where the guest can see his order as it is being entered into our POS. We wanted to make sure it was up and running before we close the lobby for construction next week. For 10 days we will be running with drive-thru only.</p>\n<p>The number one complaint at our and at any McDonald\'s is incorrect orders in drive-thru. This will eliminate one source of error, miscommunication between the guest and the order-taker. We also replaced the wireless system with improved sound quality for order taking. That should also reduce the number of errors and increase the speed of service. </p>\n<p>Christopher and I tried it out last night, and we had a great experience! Frauke knew we were coming, though, and presented the order herself. Normally children do not get a kiss from their mother when receiving orders in our drive-thru, but Christopher did. :-)</p>'},next:{fields:{title:'Is "Ami" an Insult?',date:"16 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-16-is-ami-an-insult/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"PapaScott On Tour (Not)",date:"18 Nov 2007",slug:"/2007-11-18-papascott-on-tour-not/"}}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:96,pageCount:1101}}}});
